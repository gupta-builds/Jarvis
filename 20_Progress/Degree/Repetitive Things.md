## Notebook
Gemini Notebook (the July 2026 rename of NotebookLM) runs on the Gemini 3.5 model family with no user-facing model picker — Google folded the education-tuned LearnLM behavior into the default Gemini Notebook experience rather than exposing it as a setting, which is why there was nothing to configure. [Same tool, new name: NotebookLM is now Gemini Notebook](https://it.rutgers.edu/2026/09/10/same-tool-new-name-notebooklm-is-now-gemini-notebook/), [NotebookLM April 2026 Update: New Features, Gemini Model, and Power-User Guide](https://leadershipinchange.com/p/gemini-notebooklm-ai-research-2026)

Workflow: fresh Gemini Notebook chat per chapter, upload that chapter's sources, paste the filled prompt below, save the output as the chapter note in `20_Progress/Degree/[COURSE]/Textbook/`. No chat memory carries over — if continuity with a prior chapter's terminology matters, upload that prior chapter's saved `.md` note as an extra source and say so in the prompt.

**Character limit, confirmed 2026-09-21:** Gemini Notebook's paste box rejects the single-shot ~5,590-character prompt below the master template's full length. A ~3,798-character version (cutting FORMATTING RULES, VOCABULARY RECONCILIATION, OUTPUT CONTRACT, and the content-density mandate) went through, and the output was noticeably thinner for it. Do not cut instructions to fit — split the chapter into two or three prompts fed into the **same** Gemini Notebook chat instead, each kept under ~3,000 characters. Every rule stays in every part; only the section SCOPE shrinks.

### Master prompt (reusable — fill the brackets each week, for any future course)
```
You are producing a source-grounded study note for a university course, in Obsidian-flavored Markdown, for personal study only — not a graded submission, so course AI-use policy on essays/coding does not apply, but you must still never invent facts beyond the attached sources.

SOURCES AND PRIORITY
1. PRIMARY, load-bearing source: [TEXTBOOK NAME], Chapter [N] — "[CHAPTER TITLE]". The note's structure and depth come from this chapter, in the book's own order.
2. SECONDARY, emphasis source: [LECTURE FILE NAME(S)]. Use this only to decide what to expand, which vocabulary/function names/examples the professor used verbatim, what the professor has NOT yet covered, and — importantly — whether the professor pulled in content that technically belongs to a different chapter (flag this explicitly, don't silently fold it into the wrong chapter's note).
3. BACKGROUND, non-content source: [DISCUSSION/POLICY FILE NAME]. Do not summarize this as chapter content — it is course-policy context only.

SCOPE
Cover every part of this chapter that discusses these real functions/concepts, taken from the actual lecture: [LIST OF REAL FUNCTION NAMES / CONCEPTS]. Find the book's own subsection numbers and titles yourself from the uploaded PDF — do not assume any subsection numbering I give you is correct if it conflicts with what you see in the source.

STRUCTURE — output exactly these headings in this order, nothing added or removed:
# [Chapter Title]
## Chapter Summary
One sentence claim with exactly one ==highlighted== phrase, then "*Mechanism:*" explaining how the claim works.
## Key Concepts
Every named term from the chapter, **bolded** on first use, one line each: what it means and why it matters to the chapter's argument.
## Full Reading Notes
One ### subheading per numbered subsection, using the book's own subsection numbers and titles verbatim. Every distinct claim, example, and piece of reasoning in that subsection must appear in some form — if I could learn something from re-reading the original PDF that isn't in your note, the note has failed. Reproduce named examples, numbered lists, function signatures, and code excerpts in full (as fenced code where the book gives code), don't compress into "etc."
## Worked Example
One end-to-end example (use the chapter's own running example if it has one) that ties the whole section's concepts together.
## Connections
- Lecture: what the lecture(s) emphasized from this material, which real function names/examples appeared on slides vs. only in the book, and whether the lecture pulled in content that technically belongs to a different chapter (name that chapter).
- Textbook: nothing to fill here yet, leave the line as "(pending next chapter)".
## Open Questions
3–5 items as Markdown tasks ("- [ ] ...") — genuine unresolved questions or self-test prompts a student should be able to answer after really understanding this material, not busywork.
## Flashcards
5–8 cards testing mechanisms and contrasts, not labels. Format: "Question::Answer #cards/ai" one per line, or multiline with "?" separator for longer answers.

FORMATTING RULES (violating these is a failure, not a style choice)
- Zero blank lines between a heading and its first line of content, and zero blank lines between consecutive list items or sections.
- ==highlight== markers: exactly one per major ## heading, reserved for the single most important definitional claim in that section.
- **bold**: named concepts/functions/terms on first introduction only, not general emphasis.
- *label:* italics for sub-category intro labels like *Mechanism:* or *Pitfall:*.
- No marketing or filler language: avoid words like "transformative," "powerful," "seamless," "leverage," "comprehensive," "unlock," "landscape," "journey" — say the actual mechanism instead.
- No sentence that could be pasted into a generic study-guide site unchanged. Every sentence should carry a mechanism, example, contrast, or explicit uncertainty.
- Cite page numbers for direct definitions or close paraphrases, in parentheses.

OUTPUT CONTRACT
Return the entire note as a single fenced Markdown code block (```markdown ... ```) so nothing gets reinterpreted by the chat UI when copied into Obsidian. Do not add commentary before or after the code block.

Before answering, silently verify: every numbered subsection in the scope has its own ### heading; every bolded term is actually defined; the highlight count per ## section is exactly one; the code block is the entire response.
