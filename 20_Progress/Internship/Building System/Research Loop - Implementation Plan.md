next: "2026-09-06: added a live \"# Execution Plan\" section right after this
  note's original title/banner — six ready-to-run prompts across two tracks
  (discovery-loop precision; resume/CL + company-cache beyond discovery),
  sequenced by dependency, each citing real file+line. Everything below the
  Execution Plan section is unchanged historical spec/build-review, per this
  note's own existing frontmatter note about being superseded by [[Source of
  Truth]] as the live scope reference — the Execution Plan section is the one
  new exception: it IS live and current, the rest stays historical."

# Research Loop — Implementation Plan
==The technical spec for the 24/7 discovery automation, written so a fresh Claude Code session in a separate WSL repo can build it without re-deriving anything here. As of 2026-07-19, [[Source of Truth]] is the current, consolidated statement of full scope across all six phases — read that first; this note is the historical spec and Phase 1-2 review it grew from.== [[System - Build Log]] is the retrospective record of the folder redesign; this note is the forward spec for the loop that feeds it. Obsidian stays the source of truth throughout — the automation writes into it, never replaces it.
### Execution Plan — 2026-09-06
==Live section — everything below this one (Source Verdicts, Profile Filter, Repo Structure, Phase 1-2 Build Review) is unchanged historical spec, per this note's own frontmatter. This section is the current "how"; [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Research Loop - Improvement Plan]] is the current "why/priority" — read that one first if you haven't. Two tracks, six prompts, essentialist by design: each prompt below is meant to be handed whole to a fresh, high-effort Sonnet session with no other context loaded.==

#### Standing rules for every prompt below
- Cite file+line, a commit hash, or a command's real output for every claim — non-negotiable, not optional.
- Re-verify every number/claim in this plan against live code/vault before acting on it. One claim in this plan's own diagnosis note (schema-drift coverage) was already found stale once this session — assume more might be.
- `.claude/` stays untouched. `run.yml` is not re-enabled. No new discovery sources this round. No vault dossier/promotion-note cleanup this round.
- Every new regex/rule/company entry cites the real posting/dossier it was built from, right next to the code — this repo's own `CLAUDE.md` convention, unchanged.
- Full `pytest` suite (not just touched files) green before calling anything done.

#### Track A — Discovery-loop precision (this repo's Python code, sequential by dependency)

##### Prompt 1 — Company Registry (do this first — the crucial one)
**Goal:** replace three unsynchronized, ad hoc company-level mechanisms with one structured registry, closing the "classification is whack-a-mole" gap named in the 2026-08-26 postmortem.
**Build:** `core/company_registry.py` — a loader over a small data structure (a module-level dict, or `core/company_registry.yaml` — your call, but data, not code): `{company_name: {"preference_tier": "high"|"medium"|"watch"|None, "adjacent_field": bool, "quant_bucket_override": bool}}`. Seed from what's already cited in comments: `profile.yaml`'s 11 `preferred_companies` (all currently flat `"high"` — keep them `"high"` unless you find real evidence to re-tier, re-tiering isn't this prompt's job), `core/relevance.py`'s `_ADJACENT_FIELD_COMPANY_HINT_RE` company list (fti consulting, truist, vertiv, uhy, cno financial, dimensional fund, keybank, continental resources), and a quant-firm list built from `20_Progress/Internship/Building System/V0/Dossier Corrections.md` §2 (Optiver, IMC, Chicago Trading Company — verify there are no others in that finding before assuming these three are the whole list).
**Wire in:** `core/classify.py`'s `classify()` — check `quant_bucket_override` before the three generic regexes, routing deterministically to `CyS & Finance`. `core/debate.py`'s `_TIER_RANK` — replace the flat `{"high": 0}` with real ranks from the registry, chosen so today's 11 `high`-tier companies keep their current rank-0 behavior. `core/relevance.py`'s `stage2_confirm()` — source the adjacent-field company check from the registry instead of the literal company names in `_ADJACENT_FIELD_COMPANY_HINT_RE` (leave the non-company terms — aerospace/robotics/astro/etc. — as the regex they already are).
**Test:** every existing fixture citing Optiver/IMC/Chicago Trading Company/FTI/Truist/Vertiv/UHY/CNO/Dimensional/KeyBank/Continental Resources must still pass unchanged. Add one new fixture proving an Optiver posting now lands in one deterministic bucket regardless of which keyword it also matches.
**Done when:** `pytest` full suite green, and the new fixture demonstrates deterministic single-bucket routing on a real Optiver/IMC/Chicago Trading Company posting.

##### Prompt 2 — Posting-extraction: Microsoft sidebar-bleed
**Goal:** stop "related jobs" sidebar content leaking into extracted posting text on Microsoft's careers site — same bug class as the already-fixed Google listing-shell case.
**Read first:** `mcp__jarvis__vault_read` at least 2 of the 6 flagged Microsoft dossiers (2026-W36 review names all 6: AIML & LLM, CoreAI, Cloud & Distributed Backend, Fullstack Product, Data Platform/Analytics, Security & Identity) — get the real surrounding text around the cited `[Supply Chain Program Management Intern\` line, not just the one quoted line, before writing a regex.
**Build:** extend `ingestion/posting_page.py`'s `_LISTING_SHELL_RESET_RE` (line ~195) with a Microsoft-specific (or, if the real text shows it's generic across ATS platforms, a general "related/similar jobs" heading) reset pattern — same citation-and-narrow-scope style already used for the Google and Zipline entries in that regex.
**Test:** fixtures from the real fetched content of at least 2 of the 6 Microsoft dossiers (should extract clean post-fix), plus confirm the existing Google/Zipline fixtures still pass unchanged.
**Done when:** re-running `stage1_reject` against the 6 real Microsoft dossiers' re-extracted content shows zero false positives, cited to the actual before/after text.

##### Prompt 3 — `matched_reason` DRY completion
**Goal:** give all 11 sources a real reason, not just SimplifyJobs/Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez.
**Build:** extend `run_pipeline.py`'s `build_matched_reason()` (lines 495-501) per source, using each source's own already-available structured signal: `vanshb03`/`zshah101`'s `sponsorship` field, `category` where present, the specific matched keyword `core/filter.py`'s `_matches_free_text_source` already knows for Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever/InternDock/Freehire (surface it instead of discarding it). Same shape as the two existing cases, extended — not a redesign.
**Test:** one fixture per newly-covered source showing a real, non-bare reason string.
**Done when:** `pytest` green; a spot-check against 3 real live matches per newly-covered source shows a real reason, not the literal `"matched"`.

##### Prompt 4 — Housekeeping: test DRY + doc correction + pipeline contract doc
**Goal:** three small, independent, low-risk items bundled because none needs its own prompt.
1. Parametrize `tests/test_schema_drift.py`'s 46 repeated per-source tests into `@pytest.mark.parametrize` blocks (already spec'd in [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Research Loop - Improvement Plan]]'s `# Plan` §2). Keep every real fixture; do not touch `test_filter.py`/`test_relevance.py` (real-incident regression tests, not redundant).
2. Correct the 2026-08-26 postmortem's and `Source of Truth.md`'s stale "schema-drift covers only 5/11 sources" claim via a dated correction entry (not an in-place rewrite) — it was fixed by `2fa8b76`, confirmed live 2026-09-06.
3. Write `docs/PIPELINE_CONTRACT.md` (repo root, not vault, not `.claude/`) — one page stating the contract at each stage: `core/profile.yaml`'s schema, each of the 4 GitHub Actions workflows' trigger/purpose/required secrets (`run.yml`/`recheck.yml`/`revalidate.yml`/`test.yml`), and `vault_writer/validate.py`'s `REQUIRED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` — pointing to `CLAUDE.md`'s note-template contracts for everything downstream, not duplicating it. Scoped to what's actually undocumented (the pipeline's own contract), not a rewrite of what `CLAUDE.md` already documents well.
**Done when:** test count unchanged or higher post-parametrize; `Source of Truth.md` carries the dated correction; `docs/PIPELINE_CONTRACT.md` exists and every fact in it is a real citation (file+line or workflow file), not paraphrase.

#### Track B — Beyond discovery (parallel to Track A, different dependencies)

##### Prompt 5 — Company-research cache (plain Python, ai-job-search-inspired)
**Goal:** port ai-job-search's `company_research/*.json` pattern (cited in the Pipeline Blueprint artifact, Tier 2) as a plain repo-side module — no `.claude/` skill this round.
**Build:** `core/company_cache.py` — one JSON file per company (under a new `company_research/` directory, or under `state/` — match this repo's existing state-file convention), 30-day TTL, schema mirroring what `contact-researcher` actually needs (website, LinkedIn, engineering-blog presence, GitHub org) — a cache hit is a lead the agent builds on, never a substitute for re-confirming a specific claim before it lands in a real Contact note.
**Explicitly not this prompt's job:** wiring it into the `contact-researcher` agent itself (that's `.claude/`-scoped, deferred) — build the cache module standalone, ready for that wiring once `.claude/` work resumes.
**Done when:** the module has a real test (write, read, expire-after-30-days) and a `demo()`/`__main__` self-check.

##### Prompt 6 — Main Resume.md / Main Cover Letter.md evidence-bank rebuild
**Goal:** close the one named blocker for the entire downstream Application Bench ([[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Resume & Cover Letter - System Map]]'s own `next` field has said this since 2026-08-29).
**This is not a headless prompt.** Per `Resume Alteration Standard`'s own three-source evidence rule, the human is the primary source for anything not already in a project note. Run this as an interactive session that asks Anant directly for the real fact inventory (specific projects, roles, metrics, tools) behind each resume bullet, one at a time, rather than guessing or filling a gap with a plausible-sounding invention.
**Build:** `20_Progress/Internship/Resumes/Main Resume.md` rebuilt into evidence-tagged bullets per `Resume Alteration Standard` §1/§2; `20_Progress/Internship/Cover Letters/Main Cover Letter.md` built as a paragraph/story bank per `Cover Letter Alteration Standard`.
**Done when:** both files hold real evidence-tagged content (not filler), and the two Cursor skills' Prerequisite checks (`.cursor/skills/resume-alteration`, `cover-letter-alteration`) pass for the first time.
## Correction Carried Into This Plan
Class year corrected 2026-07-16: **rising junior**, expected grad Spring 2028 (consistent — a standard 4-year timeline from a Fall 2024 start, no contradiction with the resume). Filter targets Junior-eligible **and** any-year/unrestricted postings, not sophomore-scoped ones. The HRT Sophomore worked example built last session was withdrawn as no longer eligible — see its Log entry.
## Source Verdicts (Verified, Not Assumed)
Every claim below was fetched live, not taken from the pasted Gemini/Sonnet transcript at face value — two of that transcript's claims were wrong (see Corrections below).

| Source | Machine-readable? | 2027 coverage | Junior-eligible? | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SimplifyJobs/Summer2026-Internships** | Yes — `listings.json` on `dev` branch, live, ~30 min cadence | 278 of 14,940 entries are `terms: "Summer 2027"` today (~2%, growing as the cycle ramps) | No class-year field, general board | **Primary source.** Despite the "2026" name, it's the successor of Pitt CSC and already carries 2027 postings. |
| **Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez/underclassmen-opportunities** | Yes — `listings.json` on `main`, live | No confirmed Summer 2027 season tagging yet | 17 of 112 entries (15%) explicitly `target_year: Junior (3rd year)` | **Secondary source.** Small volume but the most precisely class-typed feed that still includes you. |
| **zapplyjobs/underclassmen-internships** | No — README table only, plain markdown, no images/badges in cells (confirmed parseable) | Not date-typed | **None** — every Year column value is Freshman/Sophomore/"All student(s)", zero literal "Junior" rows | **Conditional source.** Scrape only rows tagged `All student(s)` — those are junior-inclusive despite the repo's underclassmen framing. Freshman/Sophomore-only rows are noise for this filter. |
| LuisaE/opportunities | No | Dead since Dec 2023 | N/A | Dropped. |
| interviewstreet/hiring-agent | N/A — not a listings repo, it's a resume-scoring tool | N/A | N/A | Not a discovery source. Its *concept* (score a resume against a JD) is worth mimicking as a small local tool — see Deferred Module below — but it's not part of the discovery pipeline. |
| yangshun/tech-interview-handbook | N/A — interview-prep content | N/A | N/A | Reference only. Feeds `Interviews/Interview Questions.md` and Cheats over time, not the automation. |
| Intern Dock (interndock.com) 2027 guide | No — JS-rendered SPA, no direct posting links, funnels to a signup product | Live, last updated 2026-06-20 | N/A | Drop as an automation source. Already sits in [[Links & Interlinks]] as a manual-check bookmark; that's enough. |
### Corrections To The Gemini/Sonnet Transcript
- It claimed listings.json is "regenerated by scheduled GitHub Actions." **Wrong mechanism** — no workflow in the repo has a cron trigger; an external bot pushes directly to `dev`, and in-repo Actions only react to that push. Doesn't change the plan, the ~30-min cadence claim itself held up.
- It implicitly assumed `vanshb03/Summer2027-Internships` might be a distinct successor worth polling separately. **Confirmed it's the same repo as `vanshb03/Summer2026-Internships`, renamed in place** — not a second data source. Not polled separately; would add parsing cost (README-only, badge-based Apply links) for no new data.
- It recommended `systemd` for orchestration. **Wrong platform** — the vault machine is Windows, `systemd` doesn't exist there. Irrelevant anyway once the decision landed on GitHub Actions (cloud-hosted, platform-independent).
## Profile Filter (Layer 2)
Pure field matching against each feed's own structured schema — no LLM call, no judgment, deterministic.
```yaml
# profile.yaml
grad_year: 2028
class_year: junior
eligible_class_tags: [Junior, "3rd year", "All student(s)"]  # matched case-insensitively against class/year fields when present
accept_unrestricted: true  # postings with no class-year field at all still match
terms: ["Summer 2027"]
categories: [Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence]
exclude_terms: ["Summer 2026", "Fall 2026", "Spring 2026"]  # explicit reject even if an allowed term is also present — covers multi-term/co-op postings the allowlist alone wouldn't catch
```
Match rule per source:
- **SimplifyJobs:** `terms` intersects `["Summer 2027"]` AND none of `terms` is in `exclude_terms` AND `category` in `categories` list. No class-year field exists on this feed — every match here is accepted under `accept_unrestricted`.
- **Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez:** `target_year` array intersects `eligible_class_tags`, OR array is empty/absent (`accept_unrestricted`).
- **zapplyjobs:** README row's Year column literally equals `All student(s)` — Freshman/Sophomore-only rows are excluded outright, not just deprioritized.
### Decided During Build: Dropped `locations_allow`
`profile.yaml` originally also had `locations_allow: [United States, Remote]`, but this plan never specified the actual matching rule (substring vs. exact, multi-location arrays, "Remote (US)" vs "United States", zapplyjobs having no reliable location data at all) — wiring it in during phase 1 would have meant guessing semantics under time pressure, with a too-strict guess silently dropping real matches and no error to show for it. Dropped from config entirely rather than left in as inert/unused. Location filtering is a deliberate future addition once a live run has produced real `locations` data to write fixtures against, not a same-day guess.
## Dedup (Layer 3)
Both JSON feeds carry a stable `id` — use it directly as the primary key (`src:<id>`). zapplyjobs has no ID, so its dedup key is a content hash of normalized company+role+link, same fallback pattern as the original transcript proposed. State lives in `state/seen_ids.json`, committed to the automation repo after every run — small, git-diffable, easy to inspect by hand if something looks wrong.
## Closed-Loop Write Gate (Layer 4)
==A dossier is only written into Jarvis if it passes every check below — this is the "test to verify we're ready to push" you asked for.== Fail any check → the item is logged as rejected (see Run Log) and never touches the vault. This is fail-closed by design: a broken pipeline should produce nothing, not garbage.
1. **Required fields present:** `company`, `title`, `url`, `source`, `uid` all non-empty.
2. **URL liveness:** a single HEAD request to `url` returns 2xx/3xx, not 404/410. Cheap, catches stale/pulled postings before they land in your List.
3. **Not a duplicate:** `uid` not already in `state/seen_ids.json`.
4. **Format compliance:** the generated markdown is built from a fixed template (never free-form text), so compliance with the vault's zero-blank-line rule and frontmatter conventions ([[Jarvis Writing and Formatting]]) is true by construction — the validator still checks it mechanically (no blank line between frontmatter close and title, no duplicate YAML keys, all required frontmatter fields present) as a regression guard, not a creative judgment call.
Only after all four pass: write `List/Dossiers/<uid-safe-slug>.md`, add `uid` to the seen-set, commit both in the same push.
### Dossier Note Shape
```yaml
---
uid: "src:<upstream-id>"
company:
title:
url:
source: SimplifyJobs | Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez | zapplyjobs
category:
terms:
locations: []
target_year: []
date_posted:
date_found: <run date>
matched_reason: "Junior-eligible, Summer 2027, Software Engineering"
status: unreviewed
promoted:
tags:
  - internship
  - auto-discovered
---
# <company> — <title>
Auto-discovered <date_found> from <source>. No enrichment yet — company/contact research happens on promotion, per [[30_Order/Workflows/Internship Pipeline]].
```
No prose beyond that one line — this is Layer 4, intentionally thin. Enrichment is Layer 5, on-demand only.
## Self-Improving Test Design
"Self-improving" here means test-driven, not autonomously learning — a false-positive filter match doesn't get fixed by the pipeline itself, it gets fixed by you or Claude reading the Run Log, then that fix becomes a permanent regression test. Concretely:
- **On every push:** a pytest suite validates the filter logic against known fixture listings (hand-picked examples of should-match and should-reject cases per source), the dedup function's collision behavior, and the write-gate's four checks individually.
- **On every scheduled run, before touching the feeds:** a schema-drift check — fetch one real entry from each source and confirm the expected keys are still present. If a key vanished or renamed (upstream repos change their schema without warning), the run halts and writes nothing rather than silently producing malformed dossiers.
- **On schema-drift or write-gate failure:** the workflow opens a GitHub issue in the automation repo automatically (`gh issue create`, free, no external service) summarizing what broke. This is the feedback signal that drives the next fix — not automatic, but immediate and specific instead of a silent multi-week drift nobody notices.
## Run Log
Two tiers, matching "Obsidian is the source of truth, not a noise dump":
- **Raw, per-run:** `logs/runs.jsonl` in the automation repo — one line per run: timestamp, per-source fetch count, filter-match count, new-vs-already-seen count, write-gate rejections with reasons, errors. Cheap, git-committed, never touches Obsidian.
- **Rollup, weekly:** a short auto-generated note, `10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Run Log.md`, appended (not rewritten) with one line per week: dossiers written, rejections by reason, any halted runs. This is the one piece of automation output meant for you to actually read.
## GitHub Actions Minutes
Confirmed current limits: 2,000 free minutes/month on private repos (Free plan), **unlimited standard-runner minutes on public repos**. At an every-30-min cadence (48 runs/day), a private repo hits budget if any run averages over ~1.4 minutes (checkout + fetch + filter + write + push) — plausible to exceed given three sources. **Recommendation: make the automation repo public.** The code itself (HTTP polling + a profile filter stating "CS junior, SWE/AI interests") isn't sensitive — it's less revealing than the resume already on your portfolio — and public removes the minutes ceiling entirely rather than requiring cadence tuning to stay under it. The Jarvis vault repo (destination) is a separate concern, already handled via `.gitignore` — see [[System - Build Log]].
## Deferred Module: Resume Grader
`interviewstreet/hiring-agent`'s concept (score a resume against a JD) is worth a small local mimic, not the actual tool — it's an LLM-scoring product, not something to depend on. Scope: a keyword-overlap script (JD text in, `Resumes/Main Resume.md`'s tagged bullets out, ranked by tag match) that runs locally when tailoring a resume for a specific promoted program — a Layer 6 tool, not part of the discovery loop. Not built this phase; noted here so it isn't lost.

```
## Build Order
1. `ingestion/` + `core/` + `tests/test_filter.py` + `test_identity.py` first, run locally against saved fixture JSON — no GitHub Actions, no vault writes yet, until the filter/dedup logic is proven correct by hand.
2. `vault_writer/` + `test_validate.py` next, writing into a **throwaway local test vault copy**, not the real Jarvis repo, until the write-gate and formatting compliance are verified.
3. Only then wire `.github/workflows/run.yml` to write into the real `gupta-builds/Jarvis` repo, starting at a conservative cadence (hourly), with the schema-drift check active from the first scheduled run.
4. Watch the Run Log rollup for at least one full week before trusting it unattended — this is the "tested in detail before we rely on it" requirement.
## Explicit Non-Goals (Carried Forward)
No CAPTCHA-bypass, cookie-injection, or stealth-browser automation against LinkedIn or any login-walled platform — same position as the prior Sonnet session reviewed this conversation. Contact discovery, when it happens (Layer 5, on-demand), uses public company pages, GitHub org members, engineering-blog bylines, and pattern-inferred email + MX validation only.
## Phase 1-2 Build Review (2026-07-17)
Phases 1 and 2 are done — public repo live, CI green, 48/48 tests passing, verified against the real Actions run (not just local) and mutation-tested on the critical paths (zapply filter, dedup, exclude_terms). Before greenlighting phase 3 — the phase that first touches the real, public `gupta-builds/Jarvis` repo on a live schedule — every fact and decision below was re-checked, not taken on trust from either side.
### Corrected Facts (Re-Verified Directly, Not Relayed)
- **SimplifyJobs categories were wrong in this plan.** Fetched the live `listings.json` and pulled the actual distinct `category` values: `AI/ML/Data`, `Data Science, AI & Machine Learning`, `Hardware`, `Hardware Engineering`, `Product`, `Product Management`, `Quant`, `Quantitative Finance`, `Software`, `Software Engineering`. The taxonomy visibly changed at some point — each relevant category exists in two forms (old short label and newer long label), both still present in live data. This plan's original `categories: [Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence]` matches only one of ten real values. **Corrected:** `categories: [Software, "Software Engineering", "AI/ML/Data", "Data Science, AI & Machine Learning"]` — both eras of the two relevant categories, `Quant`/`Quantitative Finance`/`Hardware`/`Product` excluded per last session's "SWE/AI/data only for now" decision.
- **zapplyjobs' "All student(s)" string doesn't exist as written.** Grepped the live README: `All student` (19 occurrences), `All Student` (2), `All Students` (1) — three casing variants, none matching the plan's literal guess. **Corrected match rule:** normalize with `.strip().lower().rstrip('s')` before comparing to `"all student"`, not a literal string match.
- **The JGCL listings.json path claim doesn't reproduce.** The build report said the path differs from this plan's assumption. Re-fetched directly just now: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez/underclassmen-opportunities/main/.github/scripts/listings.json` returns `200`, default branch confirmed `main` — the exact path this plan always specified. Either the discrepancy was in the JSON's internal field structure (not the URL) or has since been fixed upstream. **Not silently resolved** — confirm `ingestion/sources.py`'s actual JGCL URL/parsing against this re-verified path before phase 3, since one of the two descriptions is stale and I'd rather know which than assume.
### Gaps Found In The Phase 3 Scope Itself (Not Yet Built, Must Be Before The Schedule Goes Live)
- **Dependency pinning.** `requirements.txt` was unpinned through phase 2 — fine for active development, not acceptable for something meant to run unattended for months. An upstream library update breaking mid-cycle is a failure mode this plan's schema-drift check was designed to catch for *data*, not for *code dependencies* — a different risk, needs its own fix (pin exact versions before the first scheduled run).
- **Push race condition, never addressed.** The Jarvis vault already has its own auto-commit-and-push cycle running locally every ~2 hours (see [[System - Build Log]]). Phase 3's workflow will be a second, independent process pushing to the same `origin/master`. Neither this plan nor the phase 1-2 build has specified `git pull --rebase` before push or a retry-on-rejected-push loop — without it, the first real collision between the two processes either fails the run or, worse, force-overwrites something. Required for phase 3, not optional hardening.
- **State-update ordering, never specified.** `state/seen_ids.json` must only mark a `uid` as seen *after* a confirmed successful push to Jarvis — not before. If a run marks an item seen and then the push fails (network blip, the race condition above, anything), that dossier is silently gone forever: never in the vault, never retried, because dedup thinks it already landed. This plan's Layer 3 description didn't say this explicitly; it does now.
- **Schema-drift check, auto-filed issue, and the two-tier run log are all still unbuilt.** These were specified in this plan as part of the scheduled-run design, but nothing in the phase 1-2 report mentions them — they're phase 3 deliverables, not already-done work. Calling this out so phase 3 doesn't get treated as "just wire the workflow file to already-existing pieces."
### Readiness Verdict
Filter, dedup, and write-gate logic: verified correct, tested, mutation-tested — ready. Category taxonomy and zapply matching: were wrong, now corrected in this note — the phase 3 build must consume the corrected values above, not the original stale ones. Fetch-layer path: needs a direct confirm against live code, flagged above, not blocking but must be checked. Unattended-operation hardening (pinning, push-retry, state-ordering, drift/issue/log) is genuinely phase 3 scope and all still ahead. **Ready to start phase 3 with these four items as explicit, non-optional requirements — not ready to treat phase 3 as pure wiring.**
