# Claude Code Prompts — Archive
Every prompt ever run against `gupta-builds/internship-research-loop`, in order, verbatim, with what actually happened when it ran. [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts]] is the live counterpart — it holds only the guide plus whatever prompt runs next, and gets overwritten every build cycle; this note is where that content lands once a prompt is done, so nothing is lost. Read [[System - Build Log]] for the narrative/decision history around these; read this note for the prompts' exact text and exact results.

## Prompts 1-3 — Done, Confirmed Live (2026-07-26)
Persona/timing config, CS-relevance gate + priority classification, and the promote-dossier skill/agents all shipped and verified live via direct `gh api` checks the same day. Full detail in [[System - Build Log]] (this summary is all that ever lived in the prompts file for these three — never expanded here).

## Prompting Guide In Use (as of Prompts 4-5)
[Prompting Claude Sonnet 5](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-sonnet-5). Effort: `xhigh`. Front-load everything; each prompt assumes no memory of the conversation that wrote it. Two points applied specifically from Prompt 4 onward: literal instruction-following (an explicit Task Order + Files Touched table so nothing has to be inferred), and generous `max_tokens` headroom at `xhigh` effort so a long task doesn't truncate mid-response.

## Prompt 4 — Revised 2026-07-29, Run 2026-07-30, Reviewed In Detail 2026-07-30
**Executed for real** — 303/303 tests pass (258 baseline + 45 new). Independently re-verified 2026-07-30 by reading every diff directly and executing the trickiest pieces by hand: Tasks A, B, C, E, F, G, I confirmed genuinely correct. **Two real, reproducible gaps found in Tasks D and H** (Fix 1 / Fix 2 below, folded into Prompt 5's own "Fix First" section rather than re-run separately). Nothing was committed at the time this note originally described (later resolved — see Prompt 6 below, which finally committed both Prompt 4 and Prompt 5's work together on 2026-08-21).

```
You are working in gupta-builds/internship-research-loop. Context: Prompts 1-3 already shipped (core/relevance.py, core/classify.py, the priority-folder routing in vault_writer/writer.py, the /promote-dossier skill) — all confirmed live on master. This prompt was originally written 2026-07-26 and never executed (confirmed via git log — zero commits against it). A follow-up live audit on 2026-07-29 found the same bug classes recurring on new real postings plus one new bug class, and the user specified additional vault-side requirements. Read `30_Order/Standards/Internship Notes Standard.md` in the Jarvis vault before starting — it's the real, concrete contract for dossier notes (frontmatter, body structure, interlinking, removal handling, resource limits) that this whole prompt implements; it did not exist (empty file) until this revision. This prompt covers nine tasks — five real, evidence-based bugs (A-E, A also carries a design revision) plus four new requirements (F-I). Fixture files/real examples are named throughout; use the real content, don't write synthetic test data.

Before starting, confirm the assumed-live pieces actually exist — `core/relevance.py` (`stage1_reject`/`stage2_confirm`), `core/classify.py` (`classify`/`BUCKET_FOLDERS`), and the priority-folder routing in `vault_writer/writer.py`. If any of them are missing, stop and report that rather than building Tasks B/C/F/G/I on top of a false assumption — this exact failure mode (building on an unverified "already shipped" claim) is why Prompt 4 sat unexecuted for three days; don't repeat it in the other direction by assuming Prompts 1-3 landed exactly as described without a fresh check.

### Task Order
No task strictly blocks another except two real dependencies — respect these, the rest can run in any order:
1. G before H. Task H's move-to-Viewed/ logic appends to the notes: frontmatter field that Task G creates. Building H first means building it against a field that doesn't exist yet.
2. E before I. Task E fixes what gets fetched from Google's careers site (currently the wrong page); Task I improves how fetched content gets formatted. Doing I first means polishing the formatting of content Task E is about to replace anyway.
Suggested full order: B, C, D, F (independent gate/dedup fixes — any order among these four) → E → I → G → H → A (fully independent of everything else, do it whenever convenient). This is a suggestion for a sane single pass, not a hard requirement beyond the two dependencies above.

### Files Touched, By Task
| File | Tasks |
| --- | --- |
| run_pipeline.py | A |
| core/relevance.py | B, C |
| core/classify.py | C |
| core/identity.py | D |
| vault_writer/validate.py | D (tie-break reference only, no edit), G (add notes to REQUIRED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS) |
| ingestion/posting_page.py | E, F, I |
| vault_writer/writer.py | G, H (build_frontmatter, load_dossier_uids/save_dossier_uids) |
| recheck.py | H |
core/relevance.py (B, C) and ingestion/posting_page.py (E, F, I) each get touched by multiple tasks — read the file fresh before each task on it rather than working from a stale in-memory copy of what an earlier task in this same session already changed.

## Task A — Dossier count-limit, as a NOTIFICATION not a hard write-refusal (revised 2026-07-29)
Currently run_pipeline.py:66 has MAX_NEW_WRITES_PER_RUN = 18 with no per-bucket split and no ceiling on total accumulated dossiers — still true, checked directly 2026-07-29. Live counts right now, checked 2026-07-29: 1 - AI & ML 53, 2 - Fullstack 21, 3 - CyS & Finance 54, Other 11 — two buckets are already past the original 50 design number, so this is not theoretical anymore. Original design (Dossiers-to-Create.md, Source of Truth.md) said "refuse to write into a bucket already at 50" — the user explicitly overrode that framing: this is a notification mechanism, not a silent gate that drops a real eligible posting the way an exclusion rule does (that asymmetry — a false exclusion loses an opportunity for nothing, a false inclusion costs one screening read — is this codebase's founding design principle everywhere else; a hard-refusal cap violates it for no reason, since the actual scarce resource is human review attention, not vault storage). Implement:
1. A per-bucket count check before writing (still count real files in the vault checkout per bucket, same mechanism originally planned) — but do not refuse the write when a bucket is at/over 50. Keep writing; a full bucket is a signal to review more urgently, not a reason to lose a real posting.
2. A per-run write budget, still capped at roughly 10 total but split by bucket: something like 3 AI/ML, 3 Fullstack, 3 CyS & Finance, 1 Other — implement as a tunable dict, not hardcoded magic numbers spread through the function; this pacing exists to protect Firecrawl budget and review throughput, independent of the notification question above.
3. Run-record field: when a bucket's post-write count is >= 50, the run record carries an explicit bucket_at_capacity list naming which bucket(s). File a GitHub issue the first time a given bucket crosses 50 (track "already notified" per bucket in state/ so it doesn't refile every run — reuse the existing file_github_issue pattern, don't build a second notification path) and again if the global total (excluding Viewed/) crosses 190 or 200 (150/170 stay informational-only in the run log). Since 1 - AI & ML and 3 - CyS & Finance are already over 50 as of this writing, the very first run after this ships should file both bucket-crossing issues immediately if the "already notified" state starts empty — expected, not a bug.
4. Do not touch 10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers MOC.md in the vault — a live dataviewjs capacity table was already added there directly 2026-07-29 (reads real folder counts at render time, no code needs to maintain it). Task A only needs the codebase-side run-log/issue half described above.
5. Keep the existing most-recently-posted-first prioritization within each bucket's per-run allocation — don't replace that logic, just scope it per-bucket instead of globally.
Tests: fixture-based, covering a bucket at exactly 49/50/51 (assert the write still happens at 50/51, only the notification fires), the global total at 189/190/200/201, the per-bucket run-budget split respecting bucket boundaries (a bucket with 0 eligible candidates this run shouldn't consume another bucket's slots), and the "notify once per bucket" state actually suppressing a second issue on a subsequent run where the bucket is still >= 50.

## Task B — CS-relevance gate: Product/rotational/business-analyst roles slip through (real bug, recurring)
core/relevance.py's _STAGE1_REJECT_RE has no pattern for product/program management OR business-rotational-program roles — confirmed as a recurring bug class, not a one-off:
- Databricks "Product Management Intern (Summer 2027)" (AIJobs source, found 2026-07-26) — the actual role is explicitly PM work despite listing "computer science" as an acceptable major. Passed both stages, classified AI/ML purely because "Machine Learning" appears in a list of Databricks' internal team names, not because the role does ML work.
- Conagra Brands "Demand Science Rotational Analyst" (SimplifyJobs, found 2026-07-27, still live in the vault at the time) — a 2-year business rotational program with zero programming/software content anywhere in the real posting text. Passed both stages and landed in Other purely because it cleared the CS-relevance gate on no real signal at all.
Add patterns to _STAGE1_REJECT_RE catching: "product management intern," "product manager intern," "program management intern," "technical program manager intern," and separately "rotational (analyst|program)," "demand (planning|science) (analyst|rotational)," "business analyst intern" — verify against both real fixtures that genuine engineering roles which happen to mention "product" or "rotational" in passing still pass — check this distinction explicitly in a test, don't just add blunt keywords.

## Task C — CS-relevance gate: "threat" is too broad a keyword (real bug)
Mosaic (The Mosaic Company) "Operations & Automation Engineering Co-op/Intern" — a chemical-plant industrial-automation role — matched on the word "threat" appearing in a workplace-safety disclaimer, nothing to do with cybersecurity. Two real fixes needed: (1) this listing should fail stage 1 or stage 2 of the relevance gate outright (verify against the real fixture: no Python/Java/C++/git/algorithm mentions anywhere); (2) separately, _CYS_FINANCE_RE's bare threat pattern is too permissive regardless — require it to co-occur with a real security-context word (e.g. threat.{0,30}(model|actor|intelligence|detection)) rather than matching the bare word anywhere in scraped content.

## Task D — Cross-source dedup misses company-name AND title-string variants (real bug, recurring — four confirmed pairs now)
cross_source_key() (core/identity.py) keys on normalized company+title, which breaks whenever either string varies across sources for the same real posting. Four real duplicate incidents: Aquatic vs Aquatic Capital Management (company-name variant), Google BS/MS track same job ID via two sources (title-string variant), Virtu Financial triple duplicate (same Greenhouse job ID, three different title strings), Palantir "Intel" role duplicated across two different buckets (same Lever job ID via two sources, classified two different ways). Fix: prefer matching on a normalized ATS-derived identity — extract the Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever/Workday job ID or numeric ID embedded in the URL, when present, as a stronger identity signal than company+title text, falling back to the existing normalized-company+title key only when no such ID can be extracted.

## Task E — Google's own careers site: content-extraction bug (real, distinct from the earlier Ashby one)
Both Google dossiers sourced via Freehire contain a scraped Google Careers search-results listing page instead of the specific posting's own detail content — classify() fired on an unrelated listed job's title. Fix the extraction; add a regression fixture from the real content captured in this session's audit.

## Task F — Degree-requirement content check (new bug class, 2026-07-29)
Optiver "Quantitative Research Intern, PhD" (Greenhouse) resurfaced after a prior manual deletion. Add a content-level check, same shape and same permissive-by-default posture as the existing opt_exclusion() check: reject only on an explicit "PhD required," "PhD only," "doctoral candidates only," or equivalent phrasing — never on "PhD preferred," never on a degree merely appearing in a list of several acceptable ones. Do not build a feedback-loop-from-past-rejections mechanism for this now — Research Loop - Improvement Plan.md's Priority 4 already covers that gap and is deliberately gated on real rejection data existing first.

## Task G — Dossier interlinking (new, per 30_Order/Standards/Internship Notes Standard.md §1)
Add a notes: list field (YAML list of wikilink strings) to every dossier's frontmatter, always containing "[[10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers MOC]]" — insert immediately after next and before tags. Add a company/<slug> tag to the existing tags: list. Update vault_writer/validate.py's REQUIRED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS to include notes (fail-closed enforcement).

## Task H — recheck.py: move to Viewed/, don't delete (new, per Standard §4)
Replace Path(r["path"]).unlink() with a move to .../Dossiers/Viewed/ (create if absent). On move: append the Removed Dossiers MOC link to notes:, add removed_date/removed_reason, set status: removed, update state/dossier_uids.json to the new path. Same mass-deletion brake, now scoped to move counts.

## Task I — Readable, structured dossier body content (new, per Standard §2)
Stay zero-LLM. Fix: duplicate-paragraph stripping, ATS-chrome line-splitting (labels jammed against values with no separator), preserve real section structure as ### headings where the source text already states section names, strip additional known chrome (Read More markers, repeated Follow Us/social-link lists).

## Verification
Run the full test suite, report the exact pass count. Report Tasks A-I individually, re-running the real fixture cases rather than just asserting the logic looks right.
```

## Prompt 5 — Company Niche Preference, Competitive Selection Per Push, Loss-Tracked Exclusion
Written after Prompt 4's review surfaced two real gaps (Fix 1: `extract_ats_job_id()`'s Google pattern had no domain anchor; Fix 2: `move_dossier_to_viewed()` had no filename-collision handling). Both fixes were required before Prompt 5's own work.

```
You are working in gupta-builds/internship-research-loop. Context: Prompt 4 (Tasks A-I) has been run and independently code-reviewed — 303/303 tests pass, nothing committed yet. Two real, reproducible gaps were found in that review; fix both FIRST, before any of Prompt 5's own work, and confirm the fix with a real repro before moving on.

### Fix First — Two Real Gaps From The Prompt 4 Review
Fix 1 — extract_ats_job_id()'s Google pattern has no domain anchor (core/identity.py). Unlike the Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby patterns, the Google pattern matches that path shape on ANY domain. Fix: anchor to google.com. Add a regression test using an unrelated-domain URL.
Fix 2 — move_dossier_to_viewed() has no filename-collision handling (vault_writer/writer.py). Two dossiers with the identical filename can legitimately exist in two different bucket folders; moving both into flat Viewed/ silently overwrites the first. Fix: reuse dossier_filename()'s existing (2), (3)-style suffixing. Add a regression test with a constructed collision.

### Task Order
K before L (the debate comparator in L reads the preference weights K adds). L before M (M wires the comparator into Prompt 4's per-bucket budget).

### Files Touched, By Task
| File | Task |
| --- | --- |
| core/identity.py | Fix 1 |
| vault_writer/writer.py | Fix 2 |
| core/profile.yaml | K |
| core/classify.py or a new core/niche.py | K, L |
| run_pipeline.py | L, M, N |
| Dossiers MOC.md (vault) | N (Dataview sort only) |

## Task J — Where the real preference data comes from
Do not invent a FAANG/Fortune-100/YC-backed list. Research Loop - Resources.md's "Named-Program Coverage Check (2026-07-29)" section names 11 real target companies the human already identified: Jane Street (FTTP), Two Sigma (First-Year), D.E. Shaw, Citadel (Launch), Google (ASDI), Microsoft (Explore), LinkedIn (First Play), MLH Fellowship, NASA OSTEM, Capital One, Bloomberg — only 3 of 11 had any dossier coverage at the time. Use this real list as the K seed, cite the source, treat it as a human-editable starting point.

## Task K — preferred_companies in core/profile.yaml
Add a dict field (company → tier, all "high" for now). Write company_matches_preference(company, preferred) -> tier|None in core/identity.py, normalized the same way cross_source_key()'s norm() is.

## Task L — The "debate": a deterministic pairwise comparator, replacing _prioritize_and_cap's recency-only sort
Zero-LLM, no exception. debate_compare(a, b, preferred_companies) -> int via functools.cmp_to_key(), three stages each only breaking ties left by the stage above: (1) preferred-company tier, (2) bucket fill-need (cross-bucket only), (3) recency.

## Task M — Per-push limit stays Prompt 4's existing mechanism — don't build a second one

## Task N — Loss tracking and the excluded list
Track consecutive-loss count per uid in state/debate_losses.json. At 5 losses, move to state/excluded_uids.json, skip in fetch_and_filter()/dedup_new(), and append one line to a new Excluded — Losing The Debate.md log (never a silent permanent exclusion — a human can still promote by hand).

## Task O — Niche visibility, without another folder migration
Do not restructure BUCKET_FOLDERS. Add preference_tier frontmatter field (required, like every other field). In the vault, add SORT preference_tier DESC, company ASC to Dossiers MOC.md's existing Dataview tables.

## Task P — Resource check: this feature needs none, state that plainly
Confirm zero new network calls / API usage / Firecrawl fetches.

## Verification
Run the full test suite, report the exact pass count. Report both Fix-First items with real before/after repros. Report Tasks J-P individually. Nothing should be committed without being asked first.
```

**What actually happened:** Prompt 5 was executed 2026-07-30 (same session as Prompt 4's fixes) but the resulting work was never committed or pushed — it sat as an uncommitted working-tree diff on an increasingly stale local checkout for three weeks. Discovered 2026-08-21 during a full pipeline status review: local `HEAD` was 413 commits behind `origin/master` (all 413 being automated `logs/`/`state/` commits, zero code overlap), with this complete, tested (329/329 passing) Prompt 4+5 work sitting on top uncommitted. See Prompt 6 below for how that got resolved.

## Prompt 6 — Git/CI Reconciliation (written 2026-08-21, run 2026-08-21)
Written after discovering the stranded Prompt 4+5 work above. Goal: commit it safely, in a clean dependency-ordered sequence, and confirm the CI/GitHub Actions side was actually healthy (the user suspected a "broken GitHub Action," attributed to a region change while flying).

```
You're picking up internship-research-loop (/home/anant_gupta/projects/work/internship-research-loop), a zero-LLM GitHub Actions pipeline that discovers internship postings and writes them as dossiers into an Obsidian vault (a separate repo, gupta-builds/Jarvis, reached via gh/git push, not filesystem access from here). Read CLAUDE.md in this repo first — it states the load-bearing conventions (zero-LLM in the unattended path, permissive-by-default filtering, fail-closed write-gate ordering, cite-real-data-in-comments) that this task must not violate.

Your job this session is exclusively git hygiene and CI health — a clean, well-sequenced commit history and a verified-working pipeline. Do not touch dossier content, core/profile.yaml's filter thresholds beyond what's already staged, or anything in the Jarvis vault. That work is scoped to separate follow-up sessions.

## Situation
The local checkout is 413 commits behind origin/master and also has substantial uncommitted work sitting on that stale base [file list omitted here, see the original diff]. Pre-verified facts to re-confirm before acting: git merge-base HEAD origin/master equals local HEAD (3fd4b88) — pure ancestor, fast-forward-safe; origin's 413 commits touch only logs/ and state/, zero file overlap with the uncommitted diff; pytest passes 329/329 against the full uncommitted tree as-is; the per-bucket 50/global 201 capacity design is a deliberate notification-not-refusal decision, don't change it; the 3 open GitHub issues are 429/connection-reset blips against raw.githubusercontent.com from 2026-08-17/18, self-resolved, not a region/flying-related cause (Actions runs on GitHub's cloud, not the user's device) — re-verify fresh rather than trusting this.

## Steps, in order
1. Get current: git fetch, confirm merge-base claim, git pull (clean fast-forward expected).
2. Commit the staged work as 5 separate, dependency-ordered commits, running the full test suite after staging each one and before committing — never commit a state where tests don't fully pass:
   - Commit 1 — "Dedup & relevance accuracy fixes": core/classify.py, core/relevance.py, posting_page.py's phd_only_exclusion only, identity.py's ATS-job-id/cross_source_key pieces only, validate.py's cross_source_key call-site only.
   - Commit 2 — "Posting content extraction: dedup, ATS-label splitting, chrome stripping": the rest of posting_page.py, the new Google fixture.
   - Commit 3 — "Preference-tier frontmatter + Dossiers MOC interlinking": profile.yaml, identity.py's company_matches_preference, writer.py's DOSSIERS_MOC_LINK/company_slug/dump_frontmatter/build_frontmatter pieces, validate.py's REQUIRED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS addition.
   - Commit 4 — "Dossier resource-limit notifications + debate-based write prioritization + debate-loss exclusion": core/debate.py (new), run_pipeline.py (whole diff — genuinely interleaved, don't force a split), run_log.py. Depends on commit 3.
   - Commit 5 — "recheck.py: move closed dossiers to Viewed/, never delete": recheck.py, writer.py's move_dossier_to_viewed piece. Depends on commit 3.
   Use git add -p for the four files needing intra-file splits; if a hunk doesn't separate cleanly, fold it into the better-fit commit rather than forcing it.
3. Push, handling the race with the hourly automated commits — pull again immediately before push, retry once on rejection, never force-push.
4. Verify the shipped code works live: trigger gh workflow run run.yml, watch it, confirm the new fields (bucket_at_capacity, dossier_total, newly_excluded_count) appear correctly.
5. Close the 3 stale GitHub issues (after re-verifying they're genuinely resolved) with a comment pointing at a specific successful run since.

## Explicitly out of scope
Dossier content, filter/eligibility rules beyond what's staged, new features, rebasing/rewriting history, force-push, vault documentation updates.

## Report back
Final git log --oneline -10, confirmation push matches origin/master, the live workflow run's result, the state of the 3 issues, and anything your own re-verification found that contradicted what I told you above.
```

**Result, as reported back:**
```
Everything's done. Final summary:

Git log — 5 commits landed in dependency order, HEAD matches origin/master exactly (9703416, after one more automated logs/state commit landed post-push):
3ece859 recheck.py: move closed dossiers to Viewed/, never delete
080e8aa Dossier resource-limit notifications + debate-based write prioritization + debate-loss exclusion
c50792b Preference-tier frontmatter + Dossiers MOC interlinking
484b1ef Posting content extraction: dedup, ATS-label splitting, chrome stripping
722ca4d Dedup & relevance accuracy fixes

Live workflow run — triggered run.yml manually, succeeded in 1m; the new run record shows halted: false, errors: [], dossier_total: 393, bucket_at_capacity: ["AI/ML", "CyS & Finance", "Other"], newly_excluded_count: 0, written_count: 4 — all new fields present and working, and writes still happened despite buckets being over capacity (confirming the notify-not-refuse design held).

Issues #1–3 (stale HTTPError/ConnectionError) — closed with comments pointing at a specific successful run since.

New issues #4–8 — the newly-shipped capacity-notification code correctly fired for real (3 buckets over their 50-dossier threshold, global count crossing 190 and 200). This is the intended notification behavior firing for the first time, not a bug — left open since they're informational by design and closing/resolving the underlying condition is outside this session's scope.

Three findings that contradicted your brief, both fixed before landing:
1. vault_writer/writer.py's diff didn't need forcing into just commits 3/5 — it split cleanly along its own 4 hunks, no forcing needed.
2. tests/test_validate.py's entire diff was actually Task G/O preference_tier-required-field tests, not commit-1 material as listed — folded the whole file into commit 3 instead of forcing a split, per the fallback rule.
3. Real bug found via per-commit isolation testing: commit 1's ATS-job-id dedup change broke cross-source dedup between commits 1-3, because run_pipeline.py's own two dossier_keys-building call sites weren't updated to pass listing.url until commit 4's full diff — while vault_writer/validate.py's check (already in commit 1) expected the new signature. Caught when isolating commit 1 with git stash. Fixed by pulling just those 2 line-level changes into commit 1 (amended before push), keeping every commit boundary genuinely green — 282/288/301/326/329 passing at each step respectively.
```

**Follow-up — a sync error hit and fixed in the same session:**
```
Fixed and pushed — HEAD matches origin/master again, working tree clean, 329/329 tests passing.

Root cause: the CI side already handles this correctly — core/git_ops.py's commit_and_push_with_retry (used by both run_pipeline.py and the Jarvis vault push) does git pull --rebase + retry-once before every automated push, so the bot's own hourly commits never collide with each other. The gap was purely this local checkout: it has no pull.rebase/pull.ff strategy configured, so whenever a local commit sits unpushed across even one bot cycle (~40-60 min), a plain git pull in VS Code hits Git's "divergent branches, pick a strategy" refusal. That's exactly what happened — a graphify-out/ tracking commit (a128625, from an earlier session, not this one) sat unpushed while 16 bot commits landed on origin.

Resolved the immediate stuck state with a one-off git pull --rebase origin master (no config change) and pushed clean.

One thing I can't do myself: under a hard rule to never modify git config, even on request. To stop this recurring: git config pull.rebase true (local, not --global, so it won't touch other repos) — mirrors exactly what core/git_ops.py already does for the bot, keeps history linear.
```

**Independently re-verified 2026-08-22** (fresh session, all claims checked against live state, not trusted from the report): all 5 commits confirmed present with exact matching messages and correct order; `git log --oneline -1 HEAD` / `origin/master` both `89fd543` (one further commit landed since, from a separate graphify-integration session — see [[../../../../.claude/projects/-home-anant-gupta-projects-work-internship-research-loop/memory/graphify-jarvis-sync|graphify-jarvis-sync memory]] for that one, unrelated to this pipeline); working tree clean; 329/329 tests pass right now; the exact claimed run record (`written_count: 4`, `dossier_total: 393`, `bucket_at_capacity: ['AI/ML', 'CyS & Finance', 'Other']`, `newly_excluded_count: 0`, `halted: False`, `errors: []`) confirmed byte-for-byte against `logs/runs.jsonl`; issues #1-3 confirmed closed, #4-8 confirmed open with matching titles/timestamps; every scheduled run since (`run.yml`, `recheck.yml`, `test.yml`) succeeded, most recent about an hour before this check. `git config pull.rebase` confirmed still unset locally — the one item genuinely left undone, correctly, since no coding agent (this session included) is permitted to touch git config. See Prompt 7 in the live prompts file for what's next.


## Prompt 7 — Git/CI Hardening + Documentation Sync (written 2026-08-22, run 2026-08-22)
Written after Prompt 6 landed the stranded Prompt 4+5 work. What was left wasn't a bug — no local safety net against a broken commit reaching `master` (no PR gate by design), and three documents still describing the pre-Prompt-6 state.

```
You are working in gupta-builds/internship-research-loop (/home/anant_gupta/projects/work/internship-research-loop). Read CLAUDE.md first. Context: single-branch, direct-to-master convention (no PR flow) — confirm via git log. As of 2026-08-22: working tree clean, HEAD matches origin/master, 329/329 tests passing, 5 commits (722ca4d through 3ece859, 2026-08-21) shipped a per-bucket dossier capacity-notification system, a "debate" write-prioritization comparator, debate-loss exclusion, and recheck-to-Viewed (never delete). Re-verify all of this yourself before proceeding.

This session is git/CI hygiene and documentation accuracy only. Do not touch dossier content, core/profile.yaml's filter/eligibility rules, or add any new pipeline feature.

Task Q — Local pre-push test gate: scripts/hooks/pre-push (pytest gate), installed to .git/hooks/pre-push, documented in README.md's Local dev section. Verify it actually blocks (break a test, confirm push refuses; fix it, confirm it proceeds).

Task R — Sync stale documentation: Source of Truth.md's next: field and Resource Limits section (still said "not yet implemented"), System - Build Log.md (add 2026-08-21/22 entries), PRD.md (Current Status/Open Backlog/Risks — add a dated manual-check note for PAT/API-key expiry since it's not API-introspectable; check GH Actions minutes usage, report what's actually accessible).

Task S — Confirm the new pre-push hook doesn't interact badly with the existing graphify post-commit/post-checkout/post-merge hooks (different hook type, but verify with a real timed commit+push, not just on paper).

Explicitly out of scope: dossier content, profile.yaml, new features, git config changes, rebasing, force-push.

Report back: Task Q's real block/pass test results, what changed in each of the three documents, what you observed running the full hook chain, anything that contradicted this brief.
```

**Result, as reported back:**
```
All verification complete. Pre-flight: single-branch convention confirmed, working tree clean, HEAD matched origin/master, 329/329 tests, all 5 commits present as described.

Task Q: scripts/hooks/pre-push tracked, executable, committed (2e9ba00); installed copy byte-identical; README documents the cp setup. Block verified real (broke test_classify_ai_ml_from_real_bosch_content's assertion, git push --dry-run ran all 329 tests, refused with exit 1); pass verified real (fixed it back, all green, proceeded). Pushed for real, confirmed live.

Task R: Source of Truth.md next:/Resource Limits rewritten to the real shipped state, cited the 2026-08-21 run.yml trigger and issues #4-8 as evidence. System - Build Log.md got ## 2026-08-21 and ## 2026-08-22 entries matching the existing style. PRD.md Current Status/Open Backlog/Risks rewritten with real 2026-08-22 numbers; contradiction found and corrected — the prompt said Open Backlog "still lists the count-limit spec as pending," it didn't (never was); updated what actually was stale instead. Actions billing API 404'd (token lacks scope, gupta-builds is a user account) — reported as genuinely unmonitored, not guessed.

Vault push incomplete, flagged plainly: two vault-note edits committed locally (369e79af) in the Jarvis checkout but could not push — mid-reconciliation found 887 files of unrelated large-scale churn from other independent sync tools (the graphify live-sync) plus one file (Excluded — Losing The Debate.md) with local uncommitted changes blocking a clean merge. Merge attempt failed ("strategy ort failed"), git safely auto-aborted, no damage done. Stopped rather than force further action into a vault-wide conflict landscape outside this session's scope.

Task S: real timed commit+push with all four hooks present — commit 0.66s (graphify hook confirmed detached/non-blocking), push 3.69s including the full pytest run inside pre-push. No hang, no interaction between hook types.
```

**Follow-up prompt — resolving the vault push** (same session, continuation, written after independently verifying the "vault push incomplete" flag was real: GitHub's copy of `gupta-builds/Jarvis` still had the *old* stale `Source of Truth.md` text, confirmed by fetching raw content directly — the report's own content was correct and live locally, just never reached GitHub. New information supplied: `gupta-builds/Jarvis` has the `obsidian-git` plugin installed (a scheduled, independent sync mechanism unrelated to this pipeline) — almost certainly what the manual merge collided with, on top of the graphify churn. Instructed: do not retry the local merge; push the two files directly via GitHub's Contents API instead, bypassing local git state entirely.)

**Result:**
```
Both files fully verified, byte-for-byte matching the local copies (sizes: 11583 and 32016 bytes, matching the API response's size fields exactly). Local checkout confirmed as /mnt/d/Users/_Anant/10_Areas/Documents/Jarvis — the only path ever used; no git operations run against it this time, only plain filesystem reads.

Source of Truth.md — sha 742a6ab..., PUT succeeded on second attempt (first blocked by the session's own auto-mode permission classifier, not GitHub), new commit dcf2314c. Read-back confirms the next: field now reads the updated text.

System - Build Log.md — sha f1ed61c..., PUT succeeded first attempt, new commit 6151e778. Read-back confirms both new dated entries present in full.

Local checkout state, described not touched: it still sits one commit ahead of GitHub for these two files (369e79af predates the API pushes, now superseded). Working tree still has the unrelated churn. Left for the human to decide.
```

**Independently re-verified 2026-08-22** (fresh review, direct filesystem access to `/mnt/d/Users/_Anant/10_Areas/Documents/Jarvis` confirmed available from this session too): `git diff 369e79af origin/master` for both files is **empty** — byte-identical content, zero future merge-conflict risk. `git log 369e79af..origin/master` shows exactly 3 commits ahead (one routine pipeline commit, the two API pushes) — no surprise drift. `369e79af` touches only the two target files, nothing hidden. Main repo (`internship-research-loop`): `HEAD` == `origin/master`, 329/329 tests, all recent CI runs green including the hook-add and PRD-sync commits' own checks. `git config pull.rebase` confirmed `true` locally (the human ran it; silent output on a `git config` set is normal, not an error). Issues #4-8 confirmed still open and correct (the counts really are still over cap). Nothing left outstanding from this phase.


## Prompt 8 — Jarvis: Internship Note-Writing System — Standards, Templates, Workflow Doc (written 2026-08-22, run inside the vault directly)
Full prompt text: see the live file's history / the conversation that produced it — condensed here to preserve space, since the result below carries the substance. Scope: extend `Internship Notes Standard.md` (without rewriting its existing 5 sections) with date_posted/date_found semantics, target_year-empty-is-expected, the `next` chain, `matched_reason` richness; fix dead Templater syntax across all 9 Career templates; write `Tracking Standard.md` for real; investigate whether Program/Contact/Applying need their own Standards; refresh `Internship Pipeline.md`; investigate `2026-07 Found.md`'s dataview; flag (don't resolve) the `Viewed/` semantic conflict and the "review" note-type ambiguity.

**Result, as reported back:**
```
All six tasks done. §6 added to Internship Notes Standard (date semantics, target_year-empty confirmed expected via 200/200 real dossiers sampled + accept_unrestricted: true, the next chain, matched_reason richness — loop-discovered dossiers still carry the bare literal "matched", confirmed live). All 9 templates fixed — confirmed via real Appian Program/Contact/Tracker notes that Templater's <% %> syntax is genuinely dead (every real note is written directly by the promote-dossier skill, never through Obsidian's Templater engine, even though Templater is installed) — dead tags replaced with plain placeholders. Tracking Standard.md written for real (field semantics, Current/Applied/Result lifecycle) — surfaced a real live gap: Internship - Dashboard.md never queries Tracker/Each One/ at all, so a pre-application tracker note is currently invisible to the Dashboard. Program/Contact/Applying Standards: recommended NOT building them yet — low volume, human-authored not code-generated, templates already carry embedded explanatory prose, the one real Program/Contact pair shows no defects; revisit if real examples accumulate defects the way dossiers did. Internship Pipeline.md refreshed (was stale since 2026-07-29) — added the debate comparator, capacity notifications, recheck-to-Viewed; corrected the closing section's promotion count (Appian plus Uber/Western Digital/Deepgram manual finds, all still pre-application). 2026-07 Found.md dataview checked empirically: query syntax is sound; swept all 395 live date_found values, found exactly one format inconsistency (Software Engineer - Ellipsis Labs.md, unquoted date, a leftover from a manual edit) — isolated, unlikely to explain a systemically broken view on its own, query left untouched.

Flagged, not resolved: the Viewed/ conflict is real — What was Viewed.md describes "applied for", the shipped system uses it for closed-never-applied. Tracker/Each One/Applied+Result/ and Applying/Now.md already exist to serve the need What was Viewed.md describes — they're just unpopulated (zero real applications yet). Likely fix is rewriting What was Viewed.md to point at those; Viewed/ itself left untouched. "Review" note type has no match anywhere in the live internship system or CLAUDE.md's type guide — Step 2 (Screen) is the one pipeline step with no note artifact, but not asserted as the answer, just flagged.

Everything in the pre-verified context held up under independent checking — nothing turned out wrong. Session logged in 60_Claude/07_AI_Information/Session Logs/log.md. No code, no git, no dossier/Program/Contact/Tracker notes touched.
```

## Prompt 9 — Codebase: Dossier Audit — What Fails, Why, and Root Cause (Research Only) (written 2026-08-22, run 2026-08-23)
Full prompt text: see the conversation that produced it — condensed here, substance preserved in the result below. Scope: re-derive the real current filter/relevance/classify rules from code fresh; audit all live dossiers against them (six parallel background forks — one per dossier bucket, one on `Viewed/`, one on the `Excluded — Losing The Debate.md` log including a direct Citadel preference-matching trace and the TikTok volume question); report only — remove, edit, and commit nothing.

**Execution notes:** run via six background forks in parallel; two stalled on the watchdog (AI & ML, CyS & Finance) and were resumed successfully; the "Other" bucket fork's first pass was recognized as insufficient (8 tool calls in 99s, nowhere near enough to read ~140 dossiers) and re-run properly; the Excluded-log fork's first notification was mislabeled (described the AI & ML bucket's findings) and was sent back to do its actual assigned task. Full audit took roughly 45 minutes wall-clock. The AI & ML fork went further than scoped and re-ran the current rules against all 390 live dossiers, which helped reconcile several cross-bucket findings.

**Result — the full Task 7 structured report:**

What in the pre-verified starting material turned out wrong: the dossier count (393 → 390 live that day, expected hourly drift), the 57-title-flag list (real, but a floor that misses most of the actual problem), and the root-cause theory itself — "AIJobs has no category field" is real but is *not* why Zipline's 49 dossiers are bad; the actual cause is a separate, still-live extraction bug (below).

**(a) Fails an unambiguous rule — candidates for 100% removal**
1. **Zipline/AIJobs content-extraction bug — 49 dossiers, Other bucket, still live.** Zipline's URLs are a client-rendered SPA; Firecrawl can only fetch the generic `/open-roles` board-index page, so all 49 Zipline dossiers share identical fetched content — the full unfiltered job board, which happens to contain real unrelated titles like "Embedded Software Engineer, Validation." `stage2_confirm()` finds a software-signal hit on that shared page regardless of the actual role, so every one passes with the generic "genuine software engineering role, no bucket-specific signal matched" callout. Confirmed independently by two forks reading full content.
2. **Cross-source duplicates that should have deduped and didn't — ~53 dossiers in ~23 groups.** Almost all predate commit 722ca4d (2026-08-21 21:13), which correctly switched `cross_source_key()` to URL-embedded ATS job ids — no new duplicate has appeared since. Groups: Virtu Financial (×3 job-id groups), PDT Partners, Replit, General Matter, Quadrillion, Notion, Continental Resources, American Express (×4 location variants), HPR, Chicago Trading Co., Aquatic Capital Management, Freeform, DV Trading, Atoms, Melius, Appian (2 identical Excluded-log entries — a dedup gap in the exclusion path specifically). Two mechanisms remain live and unfixed: Workday postings have zero ATS-job-id coverage (FTI Consulting, Medtronic, Continental Resources duplicate pairs, defeated the text-key fallback via trivial title wording); Quadrillion/General Matter's pairs have byte-identical extractable job ids that should have caught them — points at a checkout-freshness race between writing runs, not an identity-logic bug.
3. **`location_eligible()`'s `_NON_US` denylist has real gaps**: Netherlands, Hong Kong, Poland, Israel, bare city names. Concrete passes that shouldn't have: Marshall Wace "Technology Intern - Hong Kong"/"- London", Optiver "FPGA Internship"/"Quantitative Trading Internship" (Amsterdam), plus 3 more in AI & ML.
4. **Non-technical roles passed on weak signal, confirmed by full-text read**: UHY Data Operations Intern, Continental Resources Geoscience Intern (mistagged category), Walleye Capital Finance & Accounting Intern, CNO Financial Reporting Analyst Intern, Dimensional Fund "...Data and Tools" (its sibling "...Insights..." genuinely requires SQL/Python and correctly passes), Vertiv Product Management Intern ×2, Planning Analytics Intern, Sales Data Analytics Intern ×2, Thermal Application Engineer Intern, KeyBank Data Intern, FTI Technology Intern ×2 (bucketed on a bare keyword inside a majors list, real duties are Excel/e-discovery). Root cause: `_ADJACENT_FIELD_COMPANY_HINT_RE` doesn't cover generic business/finance/BI roles, so `stage2_confirm` short-circuits to pass without ever content-checking them.

**(b) Borderline — needs human judgment, do not remove**
AVEVA "Drexel Co-op" (Drexel-only, no university-eligibility gate exists); Teledyne NHRC (classified-facility, US-citizenship-required, no citizenship gate exists); HP Enterprise Operations (overwhelmingly Supply Chain content, "software" in one closing paragraph); Optiver FPGA ×3, Jane Street Cybersecurity Analyst, Appian InfoSec Engineer (flagged by an automated re-check as stage2 failures but are real hardware/security roles on inspection — false positives from a too-broad hint regex, tighten it, don't remove these); Two Sigma "AI Research Scientist" and TMEIC Engineer Intern (fetched content is garbage — a sign-up page / raw Workday form — functionally unevaluated; "AI Research Scientist" also doesn't match any classify.py AI/ML regex literally); GuideWell Enterprise Analytics, GE Vernova Application Engineer Co-op, IMEG Innovation Services, Dimensional Fund "...Operations Insights..." (genuine judgment calls); 3 Microsoft/Google Fullstack dossiers with a dumped ~487KB careers-search page instead of real content (one already manually caught 2026-07-26).

**(c) Viewed/ findings**
Only 4 real dossiers (not "many"): Capital One SWE Intern, Capital One Cyber Security Intern, CNO Financial Cyber Security IT Intern, JP Morgan Chase Data Internship — all moved 2026-08-23, all `removed_reason: "active: false upstream"`, all corroborated by a matching `logs/rechecks.jsonl` entry. All 4 substantively correct. Real bug found instead: all 4 carry a `(2)` filename-collision suffix — `recheck.py`'s `plan_removals()` re-sweeps `Viewed/` itself (never checking `status == "removed"`), so a dossier that stays closed gets re-moved every day forever, `(2)`, `(3)`... — a re-processing bug, not a misclassification one.

**(d) Excluded-log findings, including the Citadel trace and TikTok**
Recount confirmed exact: 304 entries, 86 companies, pre-verified tallies all exactly right. **Citadel**: the mechanism is not broken — `company_matches_preference()` correctly resolves `preference_tier: high` on the bare string "Citadel". Real cause: the preference tier is a binary gate (all "high" tier ties at rank 0), recency is the only real tiebreaker among tied preferred companies; the posting (never fetched, since excluded candidates never reach `validate_and_write`) almost certainly classified into "Other" — the smallest budget (1/run) — where it lost 5 straight hourly recency ties to fresher preferred-company arrivals. A design gap (undifferentiated tier + tiny bucket budget), not a matching bug. **TikTok/volume**: sharper than gradual crowding — 287 of 304 exclusions (94%), including 106 of TikTok's 107, happened in a single day, 2026-08-21 — a burst, not a trickle. Spot-checked 20+ TikTok lines: genuinely distinct postings, not re-logged duplicates. Real mechanism: a large batch of new candidates across many companies arrived "new" in the same window, all lost fixed per-bucket budgets to each other for 5 consecutive hourly runs, all crossed `MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES` together in one run — the system can't distinguish "genuinely undesirable" from "the queue is temporarily backed up," and converts a transient backlog into permanent exclusion within ~5 hours. Per-company breakdown: American Express (18), RTX (11), The Nuclear Company (8) — genuine volume-crowding of real distinct postings, not a leak. **Zipline (13), Varda Space Industries (13), Astranis (6) are the important exception** — genuinely non-technical titles mixed in (Zipline "Sales Operations Analyst"; Varda "Biologics Formulation Research," "Environmental Health & Safety"; Astranis "Mechanical Engineer," "CAD Engineer-Librarian") that were never content-checked, because excluded/losing candidates never reach the Firecrawl fetch — the same latent failure mode as (a)#1/#4, just hidden by losing the volume race instead of being caught by a gate. Uline (5), Springs Window Fashions (5) show the identical pattern.

**(e) Date/target_year empirical findings**
Both behave exactly as the code predicts, no evidence of guessing or dropped data. `date_posted`: real ISO date in every dossier except the 2 `source: manual` entries (expected — manual entries skip `normalize_*`/`_iso_date()`, and `_iso_date()` returns `None` on a falsy epoch, never a placeholder). `target_year`: empty `[]` on all 390 live dossiers, zero exceptions, matching `ingestion/normalize.py` (only `normalize_josegael` ever populates it) — more interesting: **zero live dossiers currently come from source "Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez" at all**, across all four buckets — not itself a rule violation, but worth checking `logs/runs.jsonl`'s `filter_match_counts["Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez"]` directly for silent degradation. Separately (a content-quality bug, not a filter bug): Microsoft ×2 and a Google/Freehire Fullstack dossier contain a dumped ~487KB generic careers-search-results page instead of the actual posting.

**(f) Recommended profile.yaml/filter changes (described, not implemented)**
1. Detect SPA-board-index-shaped fetched content (link-dominated, not prose) and treat as thin/unconfirmed rather than a real stage2 pass — fixes the Zipline leak.
2. Tighten `_ADJACENT_FIELD_COMPANY_HINT_RE` (space/defense too broad; extend to generic business/finance/BI families) — same co-occurrence-window pattern as the 722ca4d threat fix.
3. Add Netherlands, Hong Kong, Poland, Israel to `_NON_US`; consider a bare-city fallback.
4. Extend `_ATS_JOB_ID_PATTERNS` to Workday's `myworkdayjobs.com` shape (strip trailing `-N`).
5. Un-tie the preference tier — a graded/ranked scheme or a diversity tiebreaker so one preferred company can't be crowded out by another preferred company's fresher posting in the same tiny bucket budget.
6. Reconsider `MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES=5` (~5 hours) relative to real arrival burstiness.
7. One-time retroactive re-sweep of pre-722ca4d dossiers against current rules — flag, don't auto-delete (a couple of true positives, Optiver FPGA / Jane Street / Appian security, would be wrongly killed by a naive re-run).

**(g) Recommended GitHub Actions/pipeline enhancements (described, not implemented)**
1. A periodic re-validation job that re-checks existing vault dossiers against current code and files a digest issue for anything that would now fail.
2. Fix `recheck.py`'s `plan_removals()` to skip files already under `Viewed/` (or check `status != "removed"`) — stops the daily re-move/`(N)`-suffix bug in (c).
3. A per-run alert when debate-loss exclusions spike well above the normal trickle (e.g. >20 in one run) — would have surfaced the 2026-08-21 burst as it happened.
4. A direct check of whether Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez is still returning candidates in recent runs.


## Prompt 10 — Codebase: Act On The Task 7 Audit (written 2026-08-23, run 2026-08-23)
Full text: see the conversation that produced it. Four phases: fix the 5 root-cause bugs (Zipline SPA-detection, `recheck.py` Viewed/ re-sweep, `_NON_US` gaps, adjacent-field hint tightening with regression protection for known false positives, Workday ATS-id pattern), then act on affected dossiers (re-evaluate Zipline, remove confirmed non-technical/non-US, dedupe legacy duplicate groups, touch nothing borderline), one cheap JGCL health check, two new GitHub Actions features. Two items explicitly left for a human decision: preference-tier grading, `MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES` retuning.

**Result:**
```
367 tests passing (up from 329), 7 commits, full suite green throughout.

Phase 1 (5 commits, 38 new tests): Zipline SPA board-index bug (ceeea7d, 4 tests), recheck.py Viewed/ re-sweep bug (2eb6bab, 1 test), _NON_US denylist gaps (c397413, 6 tests), space/defense false-positive fix + business/finance/BI hints (fbf934a, 15 tests), Workday ATS-id pattern (084e3da, 3 tests). Notable finding: a company-wide gate for Walleye Capital would have wrongly failed a genuine "Data Science Intern" role with no signal-word match in real content — kept narrow. KeyBank/Truist's bad dossiers still pass even post-fix because their real content literally mentions Python/SQL as a tool-list/team-name aside, not a real requirement — a documented limitation of the keyword-only check, not something this fix closes.

Phase 2 (44 dossiers removed, recoverable): 13 confirmed non-technical (UHY, CNO Financial, Vertiv ×5, Walleye Finance, Continental Resources Geoscience, Dimensional Fund "Data and Tools", FTI ×2), 7 non-US (Optiver ×2 Netherlands, Google ×2 Israel, Marshall Wace ×3 Hong Kong/London), 24 legacy cross-source duplicates (Virtu ×3 groups — 7 removed, one extra duplicate found during verification not in the original audit — plus PDT Partners, Replit, Notion, Melius, Deepgram, Chicago Trading Co. cross-bucket, Freeform, Atoms, DV Trading/Group, HPR, General Matter, Quadrillion cross-bucket 3-way, Medtronic, Continental Resources Data Analyst). Explicitly not removed, correcting the earlier audit's over-broad characterization: Vertiv "Operations Intern - Summer 2027" (real Python/SQL/data-pipeline requirements, genuinely fine). Left borderline, not removed: KeyBank/Truist (documented false-pass above). American Express's ~20 entries explicitly skipped — too much risk of conflating legitimately-different postings without individually verifying each URL, flagged for follow-up. Zipline's 49 dossiers untouched — the code fix shipped and tested, but re-evaluating existing dossiers needs a real Firecrawl fetch, and this session reported FIRECRAWL_API_KEY unavailable to it (later found to be a session environment-sourcing gap, not a real absence — it's in ~/.bashrc).

Phase 3: Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez not degraded — fetches 4-5 real candidates on nearly every recent run; zero live dossiers today is explained by the already-documented 2026-07-18 manual vault cleanup (13 JGCL uids sit in seen_ids.json with no corresponding live file). Correctly a no-op.

Phase 4 (2 commits): revalidate.py + .github/workflows/revalidate.yml (weekly re-validation against current rules, files a digest issue). should_alert_on_exclusion_spike() in run_pipeline.py, fires when exclusions exceed 20 in one run, citing the 2026-08-21 burst.

Flagged, not implemented: preference-tier grading (Citadel's mechanism isn't broken, it's undifferentiated — a graded scheme vs. a diversity tiebreaker is a real design choice); MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES retuning (5 consecutive losses converts backlog into permanent exclusion fast, as the burst showed — the right number or a different mechanism is a design call).
```

## Prompt 11 — Jarvis: Sync Building System, 30_Order, Graphify Mirror (written 2026-08-23, run 2026-08-23)
Full text: see the conversation that produced it. Five tasks: record the Task 7 audit in `System - Build Log.md`/`Source of Truth.md`; cross-reference Building System/30_Order docs against the graphify mirror for drift Prompt 9 wouldn't have caught; confirm the graphify-deletion incident stays closed; re-check whether Program/Contact/Applying Standards are still not needed; re-flag the still-open `Viewed/` conflict and "review" ambiguity.

**Result:**
```
Task 1: System - Build Log.md got a ## 2026-08-23 entry with the audit's headline findings, full detail pointed at the Archive note. Source of Truth.md corrected only what the audit actually contradicts — Hard Gate §2 (location) and §4 (CS-relevance) each got a cited caveat that the design is right but the implementation has real gaps; Resource Limits got the debate-comparator design-gap paragraph and dedup status; Priority Classification got the Viewed/ re-sweep bug. The closing "What Closing The Loop Means Here" section was rewritten to say verification is stale as of 2026-08-23 rather than still claiming discovery is "independently verified solid." Everything else left untouched — nothing else was contradicted. Internship Pipeline.md got one added line so it doesn't read as already-fixed either.

Task 2: Confirmed the graphify mirror is a pure structural mirror (function/file/test call-graph, no source text), static at 89fd543/f75662ac. Spot-checked names cited in Standards/Source of Truth docs — build_frontmatter(), opt_exclusion(), extract_content() (plus its real regression tests), validate.py, plan_removals(), debate.py/debate_compare(), location_eligible() all confirmed real nodes. A handful of cited constants (REQUIRED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS, _NON_US, _ADJACENT_FIELD_COMPANY_HINT_RE, BUCKET_CAPACITY, MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES, dossier_uids.json) have no node — consistent with the mirror never node-ifying bare constants/JSON state, not a doc inaccuracy. Nothing further found beyond Prompt 9's own audit.

Task 3: Deletion incident confirmed closed — verified f75662ac directly, content matches its message exactly. Exactly one commit has touched that folder since (f6e056e7), and it only rewrote graph.canvas (visual layout) — zero new node files added or removed. No new orphans. The underlying graphify manifest-writer bug still unfixed but flagged only, not touched.

Task 4: Program/Contact/Applying Standard recommendation stands — Prompt 9's audit scope never touched those note types, no new evidence either way.

Task 5: Both items re-flagged, no new decision given at the time — the Viewed/ semantic conflict and the "review" note-type ambiguity. (Both resolved by the human immediately after this report — see Prompts 12/13.)
```


## Prompt 12 — Codebase: Ship The Two Decided Design Changes, Finish The Deferred Cleanup (written 2026-08-23, run 2026-08-23)
Full text: see the conversation. Reserved additive preferred-company slot per bucket, `MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES` 5→48, American Express individual verification, Zipline 49-dossier re-fetch (confirmed unblocked — `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` was in `~/.bashrc` all along).

**Result:**
```
All committed separately, pre-existing unrelated CLAUDE.md/graphify-out changes left untouched. 372 tests passing throughout.

Task A (288b390): additive reserved slot in _prioritize_and_cap, never carved from existing budget. 3 tests: losing preferred candidate wins via reserved slot; no-preferred bucket unchanged; 3-way preferred recency tie-break.

Task B (23e52db): MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES 5→48, citing comment updated with the 2026-08-21 287-exclusion burst. Existing tests rewritten to reference the constant, not hardcoded values.

Task C (3b99251): American Express — 18 entries (not ~20), 15 distinct, 3 genuine duplicate pairs (same numeric job ID under egug.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com, differently punctuated titles). Added an Oracle Cloud HCM ATS-id pattern, domain+path anchored, 2 tests.

Task D (vault-only, no commit): Zipline's 49 dossiers fully re-verified with live Firecrawl content. 12 kept (genuine SWE-relevant — Computational Physics, Controls Engineer ×2, Enterprise Systems SWE ×2, Long Range Platform Embedded Firmware, Perception, Software Engineer Intern (Sp), Software Systems Validation ×2, System Test Automation ×2), 37 removed (confirmed non-technical by real content, moved to Obsidian trash not permanently deleted).
```

## Prompt 13 — Jarvis: Implement The Two Decided Vault Changes (written 2026-08-23, run 2026-08-23)
Full text: see the conversation. Rewrite `Viewed/What was Viewed.md` per the "keep existing design" decision; build a real, lightweight Step 2 (Screen) artifact per the "yes, real lightweight artifact" decision, choice of implementation left to the executing session weighed against the `company/<slug>`-tag precedent.

**Result:**
```
Task 1: Viewed/What was Viewed.md rewritten — Viewed/ holds closed-never-applied postings (Standard §4, recheck.py's real behavior), points at Applying/Now.md + Tracker/Each One/Applied+Result/ for the "have I applied" need, both empty since zero real applications exist yet. Cited Prompts 8 and 9 (Archive) as the two independent sources for this read. Added a live dataview of Viewed/'s real contents; kept the original "organize by month once big" instinct, redirected at the correct purpose.

Task 2: Chose frontmatter fields (screened_date/screened_decision/screened_reason on the dossier), not a separate note type. Explicit reasoning: the company/<slug>-tag-over-hub-note precedent applies with more force here (per-dossier, potentially hundreds of times, vs. per-company). A Screen call is a short state-transition fact (same shape as §4's removed_date/removed_reason), not a growing research artifact the way a Program note is. status left untouched (Screen is orthogonal to unreviewed/removed/promoted, not merged in). Contact reachability deliberately gets no field, matching Pipeline Step 2's existing "noted, never a gate" rule.

Task 3: New §7 in Internship Notes Standard.md (field spec + the precedent-weighing reasoning + "not retroactive"/"not yet automated"). Internship Pipeline.md's Step 2 now points at the real fields.

Flagged, not touched (per scope): Viewed/Removed Dossiers MOC.md — the note every removed dossier's notes: field is required to link to — is itself still empty. Noted for a later prompt. Nothing from Prompt 12 described as shipped anywhere in this work.
```


## Prompt 14 v2 — Codebase: New Discovery Sources, Refined With Real Yield Data + InternDock (written 2026-08-24, run 2026-08-24)
Full text: see the conversation. Refined before ever running with real per-source yield numbers (fetched vs. matched over the last 20 runs) and two real InternDock URLs the human provided. Seven tasks: resolve JGCL's zero-yield question, diagnose Ashby/Freehire's low yield, evaluate InternDock as an ongoing source (contingent on a real discoverable index existing), verify a web-search claim about zshah101 having a richer API, build Lever if a second real company is found, investigate LinkedIn's Greenhouse board + 7 other named-priority companies, re-verify speedyapply/sndsh404 and sweep for new repos.

**Result:**
```
2 commits, 372+ tests passing throughout (exact new count not restated in the summary — see the repo directly).

Task 1 — JGCL: the SOURCES-tuple-tie-break hypothesis in the prompt was WRONG. Real cause, confirmed by live replay: JGCL's entire currently-matching pool is 3 postings (MLH Fellowship, White House HBCU Scholars Program, UNCF Scholarships Portal) — non-software scholarship/fellowship programs, already in seen_ids.json because they were written once then manually deleted during the 2026-08-23 dossier-audit session (46 vault_delete calls, auto-captured as "08-23 Internship dossier audit and filter-rule reconciliation," 241 min) — a human judged them not real matches, and seen_ids' own semantics mean they never get re-offered. Two more (TMCF, AAUW, also scholarships) already hit MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES and sit in excluded_uids.json. Conclusion: not a bug, JGCL's feed is just thin and skews toward non-CS scholarships for this persona. No code change.

Task 2 — Ashby/Freehire: both confirmed working as designed. Ashby: live-checked all 9 seeded companies, genuinely only ~4 have open roles right now. Freehire: FREEHIRE_COMPANIES is deliberately just {google, uber} by design (documented, not an oversight); live fetch returned 6 postings, mostly non-US/non-eng, correctly filtered downstream. No bugs, no changes.

Task 3 — InternDock: interndock.com/sitemap.xml is a real, live, plain-HTTP index with more drop-shaped slugs than the 2 originally found — this is a real ongoing source, not a one-time snapshot. Built ingestion/interndock.py: sitemap-based candidate detection + a posting parser built from real verbatim text (the actual link text is always "Apply", not the title — the original guessed format was wrong). Slug shape alone is unreliable (one drop-shaped slug is actually a prose article, not a listing) — the real gate is structural match-count within the fetched page. 6 new tests, all passing. Scope deliberately stopped at detection+parsing — full SOURCES wiring (id strategy, state file, cadence) flagged as needing its own design pass, not built yet.

Task 4 — zshah101 RSS/API claim: confirmed TRUE (real RSS feed, docs/api/jobs.json, live dashboard) — but a prior session had already evaluated this exact tradeoff and deliberately chose data/jobs.json (497 raw entries, full truth) over the pre-filtered API (243 entries, someone else's filter applied first). That reasoning still holds today, gap is bigger not smaller. No change.

Task 5 — Lever: found real dossier URLs for a second genuine Lever-hosted company (Belvedere Trading, plus Hermeus/Xsolla candidates surfaced, one ruled out as a nonprofit not a tech employer). Built fetch_lever/normalize_lever mirroring Greenhouse/Ashby's per-company pattern, wired into SOURCES and recheck.py's FEEDS. Live-verified end-to-end: 61 postings fetched, 3 real matches, cross-source dedup against existing Palantir dossiers confirmed working via the existing write gate.

Task 6 — LinkedIn's Greenhouse board confirmed real but 0 intern postings anywhere in it — genuinely nothing there, not a detection failure. None of Two Sigma/Citadel/Capital One/Bloomberg/Microsoft/NASA/MLH have a reachable Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever token (confirmed via direct API probes) — all enterprise-scale, almost certainly on Workday-class ATSes this pipeline has no connector for. Correctly not built.

Task 7 — speedyapply/sndsh404 both still structurally blocked (private Supabase backend; README + binary .xlsx only — re-confirmed, not stale). Found SuryaHarikrishnan/2027-internship-tracker (13,180 entries) but it's 100% re-aggregated from SimplifyJobs+vanshb03 already-integrated data — zero unique value, correctly skipped. Two genuinely new, real, structured candidates surfaced and NOT yet built: ApplyGuy/2027-Internships (real JSON, e.g. "Toyota of Cedar Park Keating LLC — Software Developer Intern," posted today) and dreamworkhq/Tech-Internships-2027 (real JSON, 720 entries, e.g. Fannie Mae Data Science Intern) — flagged for a future round.
```

## Prompt 15 — Jarvis: Refresh Both Resources Docs, Close The Removed Dossiers MOC Gap (written 2026-08-23, run 2026-08-24)
Full text: see the conversation (unchanged from its original write-up). Three tasks: refresh `List/Resources.md`'s operational per-source table with real numbers, refresh `Research Loop - Resources.md`'s Named-Program Coverage Check, build `Viewed/Removed Dossiers MOC.md` for real.

**Result:**
```
Task 1: List/Resources.md refreshed with real 2026-08-24 numbers — SimplifyJobs 137 live dossiers (was 138 pre-removal-batch, 1.5% match rate), vanshb03 74 (was 77, 26.6%), zshah101 68 (12.1%), Greenhouse 16 (53.6%, structurally capped), AIJobs 11 (25.6%), Freehire 2 (28.6% but tiny volume, flagged open), Ashby 0 live (structurally capped), Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez 0 live despite 76 real matches over 20 runs — flagged explicitly as "under investigation" at the time, pointing at Prompt 14 (since resolved — see above, not a bug).

Task 2: Research Loop - Resources.md's Named-Program Coverage Check re-checked against real frontmatter. Coverage moved 3/11 → 5/11: Jane Street still 11 (unchanged), D.E. Shaw still 1, Google still 3 (no ASDI mention), Microsoft 0→6 (checked for "Explore" — only false-positive JS chrome matched, still unconfirmed as the named program), Two Sigma 0→1 (no "First-Year" mention, generic). Capital One actually dropped 2→0 (both closed, moved to Viewed/ on 2026-08-23 — noted as churn, not a real gain). Citadel, LinkedIn, MLH, NASA, Bloomberg remain uncovered (since resolved — see Prompt 14 v2 Task 6 above: no viable connector exists for any of these, not a discovery gap).

Task 3: Viewed/Removed Dossiers MOC.md was a real 0-byte file despite 4 live dossiers linking to it. Built for real per the MOC Standard (Purpose → Map → Status → Dataview): documents the one real removal batch (4 dossiers, all 2026-08-23, all active: false upstream), including the Capital One same-day double-closure as a hiring-cadence signal. Corrected the prompt's own stale estimate ("dozens" of dossiers pointing here) to the real current count (4).

### Prompt 16 — Jarvis: Sync Building System To The Real Post-Prompt-14v2 State (written 2026-08-24, run 2026-08-24, archived 2026-08-27)
No execution report was ever pasted back for this session — archived here from independent verification of live vault state against all 4 tasks, not from a human-provided report, per the explicit ask to clean this up before adding new content.

Full text:
```
**Run inside the Jarvis vault directly** (Windows, Sonnet 5, high effort). Vault-note work only.

**Context — what actually changed, verified, not to be re-derived:** Lever shipped live (`fetch_lever`/`normalize_lever`, wired into `SOURCES`/`recheck.py`, 2 real companies — Palantir plus Belvedere Trading — 61 postings fetched, 3 real matches at build time). InternDock got real detection+parsing code (`ingestion/interndock.py`, sitemap-based, 6 tests) but is **explicitly not wired into `SOURCES` yet** — a partial build, not a live source; don't describe it as one. The JGCL zero-yield question is **resolved**: not a bug, three specific scholarship postings (MLH Fellowship, White House HBCU Scholars, UNCF Scholarships Portal) already correctly excluded via `seen_ids`/`excluded_uids`, the feed is just thin toward non-CS content for this persona. LinkedIn's Greenhouse board and the other 7 named-priority companies (Two Sigma, Citadel, Capital One, Bloomberg, Microsoft, NASA, MLH) are **confirmed dead ends for direct-ATS coverage**. Two new, real, unbuilt repo candidates exist (`ApplyGuy/2027-Internships`, `dreamworkhq/Tech-Internships-2027`). The 2026-08-23 "46 `vault_delete` calls" is a real, already-tracked session, not an untracked event.

Task 1 — `System - Build Log.md`: add a `## 2026-08-24` entry recording Lever, InternDock's partial build, the JGCL resolution, the LinkedIn/7-company dead-end finding, the two new unbuilt repo candidates, and confirmation the 2026-08-23 deletions are accounted for. Point at the Archive note rather than duplicating detail inline.

Task 2 — `Source of Truth.md`: fix now-wrong claims. At minimum: any "eight sources" claim is now wrong (nine, with Lever) — a partial InternDock build should not count as a tenth live source. Correct the JGCL/LinkedIn-7-company framing if referenced with the older, vaguer wording.

Task 3 — `Research Loop - Resources.md`: move Lever to the live sources table with real numbers; add InternDock as its own in-between status; re-confirm speedyapply/sndsh404 stay deliberately-not-built and add ApplyGuy/dreamworkhq as found-but-not-yet-evaluated; correct the JGCL entry to the real specific finding; rewrite the Named-Program Coverage Check framing — the month-old open question is now answered (no, none of the 8 named companies post through Greenhouse/Ashby).

Task 4 — `10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Resources.md`: resolve the JGCL "under investigation" flag to the real, closed finding.

Explicitly out of scope: no code changes to internship-research-loop; no describing InternDock/ApplyGuy/dreamworkhq as more done than they were at the time.

Report back: per task, what changed and where, with the specific old-vs-new claim for anything corrected.
```

**Result** (reconstructed 2026-08-27 from direct comparison of live vault state against all 4 tasks — no report was ever reviewed for this session, matching the handoff's own flag):
```
Task 1 — System - Build Log.md: a matching entry exists ("2026-08-24 — Prompt 14 v2: Lever Shipped, InternDock Partial, JGCL Resolved, LinkedIn/7-Company Dead End Confirmed"), covering the exact content this task asked for. Confirmed present via document-map heading check.

Task 2 — Source of Truth.md: confirmed done at the time — the doc's sources section read "Nine Sources" as of 2026-08-24, per that section's own later self-correction ("the 'Nine' heading... was stale within a day of being written," added 2026-08-27 once Lever+InternDock+ApplyGuy pushed the real count to eleven). The eight→nine correction is confirmed as this task's real output; its own later staleness (nine→eleven) is expected drift already caught and fixed by a subsequent pass, not a failure of this task.

Task 3 — Research Loop - Resources.md: confirmed done — live headings match exactly: "Live, Committed... (Lever added 2026-08-24)", "InternDock — Built, Not Yet Wired (2026-08-24)", "Found, Not Yet Evaluated For Build (2026-08-24)" (ApplyGuy/dreamworkhq), "Named-Program Coverage Check (refreshed 2026-08-24) — Coverage Gap Remains, Connector Question Now Closed".

Task 4 — List/Resources.md: confirmed done — the JGCL flag is resolved; cross-referenced via this Archive's own Prompt 15 result text, which already carries a "(since resolved — see above, not a bug)" annotation reflecting this correction.

All 4 tasks show real, matching artifacts in the live vault; nothing found contradicting the prompt's asks. Treated as fully executed.
```

### Prompt 17 — Codebase: Finish InternDock's Wiring, Evaluate The Two New Repo Candidates (written 2026-08-24, run 2026-08-24, archived 2026-08-27)
No execution report was ever pasted back for this session either — archived here from direct git log/diff inspection of commit `1d27f5b` (2026-08-24 02:41), which carries its own detailed reasoning in the commit message.

Full text:
```
**Fresh session**, `gupta-builds/internship-research-loop`. Read `CLAUDE.md` first. `ingestion/interndock.py` exists (sitemap-based detection + parser, 6 tests) but is not wired into `SOURCES` — verify this yourself before starting.

Task 1 — Design and ship InternDock's SOURCES wiring. Real open questions to resolve, not guess at: identity/uid strategy (no native id the way Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever have — check the real `href` URLs for a stable identifier, or fall back to a content-hash approach, naming that explicitly as a real limitation if so); cadence/state (sitemap-based detection cadence is a real design decision — InternDock's own two known drops were ~6 weeks apart, don't assume hourly); volume/capacity interaction (a single drop is ~650-658 postings, far more than one run's write budget — confirm the existing per-bucket budget/deferred mechanism handles this gracefully). Build it, wire into SOURCES, add to recheck.py's FEEDS if applicable, fixture-based tests, full suite green.

Task 2 — Evaluate ApplyGuy/2027-Internships (confirmed real JSON, example: "Toyota of Cedar Park Keating LLC — Software Developer Intern"). Verify the schema fresh, check scale/update frequency, decide with the same rigor as every existing source's original evaluation whether it's worth building. Build if yes; say so plainly if not.

Task 3 — Evaluate dreamworkhq/Tech-Internships-2027 (confirmed real JSON, 720 entries, richer schema with salaryMin/salaryMax/aiRoleKind/postedAt/firstIndexedAt). Same evaluation discipline as Task 2.

Discipline: separate commits per source, real citations, fixture-based tests, full suite green at every step.

Report back: Task 1's identity/cadence/state decisions and why, confirmation InternDock is genuinely live in SOURCES, real numbers from a live test run. Task 2/3: built or not, with real reasoning either way.
```

**Result** (reconstructed 2026-08-27 from direct git inspection):
```
Task 1 — InternDock wired end-to-end, confirmed live via `grep fetch_interndock run_pipeline.py`. Real design decisions made: identity = the posting's own real Apply URL (not a content hash — every InternDock entry carries a real employer ATS link; `cross_source_key` already collapses these against direct Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever copies via its existing ATS-URL job-id regexes, no changes needed). Cadence/state: event-driven, not fixed — `state/interndock_seen_guides.json` persists which sitemap guide URLs have been Firecrawl-fetched, fetching each new one exactly once (real drops are ~6 weeks apart, so hourly sitemap.xml polling is free and the one paid Firecrawl call only fires when something's genuinely new). Doesn't fit the uniform SOURCES tuple (needs Firecrawl + persisted state) — it's a separate step in `run_once()`, inserted last so cross-source-duplicate ties resolve toward direct per-company sources; not wired into recheck.py's FEEDS (re-verifying would mean re-Firecrawling every seen drop page for marginal value). Volume-tested: a live-simulated 650-posting spike drains gracefully through the existing budget/debate mechanism (this_run=4, deferred=646, no crash, no silent drop) — but surfaced a real, separate finding not fixed here: 14/15 real fixture titles land in the "Other" bucket (budget 1/run) because `classify()` doesn't recognize generic "Software Engineering Intern" titles as Fullstack/AI-ML/CyS&Finance, a real future bottleneck flagged for a separate decision.

Task 2 — ApplyGuy built and shipped. Confirmed live 2026-08-24: 202 real entries, own-sourced (not a re-scrape, unlike SuryaHarikrishnan/2027-internship-tracker, checked and rejected same-day), updates ~every 15 minutes, reaches Workday/Workable/Paylocity ATSes with zero other coverage. ~39% of entries (78/202) carry a literal "Not specified" season placeholder, deliberately mapped to empty terms at normalize time. Live-verified: 200 fetched, 137 real matches at build time — notably higher yield than every other source. Not wired into recheck.py's FEEDS (left open, no evidence either way on absence-from-feed reliability). 385 → 401 tests, full suite green.

Task 3 — dreamworkhq/Tech-Internships-2027 evaluation: **never executed.** No commit, no code, no test, no mention anywhere in git history. Confirmed by direct search (`git log --all --grep`, grep across `ingestion/` and `tests/`) — this is a real, honest gap, not a "evaluated and declined" result. Still a real, open candidate (720 real entries, richer schema) if a future session wants it — not urgent given the write-starvation bottleneck this project is currently prioritizing over new source growth (see the 2026-08-26 postmortem and Prompts 18/19).
```

### Prompt 18 — Codebase: Write-Gate Failure Memory — Stopgap + Root-Cause Fix (written 2026-08-27, run 2026-08-27/28)
Full text: see the conversation (unchanged from its original write-up) — recompute urgency, stopgap-if-warranted, confirm win-mechanism, build `write_gate_failures.json`.

**Result:**
```
Committed at 778f531 (not pushed — no push without explicit ask, per repo convention).

Task 1 — fresh numbers (as of 2026-08-28 ~09:00 UTC): debate_losses.json 338 entries (up from 271), max=30 (2 uids), largest cohort at 27 (148 entries, 143 ApplyGuy:*). excluded_uids.json still 388, zero ApplyGuy exclusions. Real growth rate measured from state history (not estimated): 24→30 took ~40 hours, i.e. ~6.6-9.85 hr/loss — slower than the postmortem's original ~3hr/loss pace, because run.yml is bursty (gaps up to 11h), not truly hourly. Verdict: NOT urgent — front reaches 48 in ~5-7+ days at current pace, runway growing not shrinking.

Task 2 — no MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES bump. Runway is days-scale and growing; the root-cause fix should ease pressure rather than just outrun it.

Task 3 — proceeded straight to the fix rather than adding throwaway logging. The cited dead-link uid still appeared in 186/186 checked runs including the very latest, and a real integration test drives it through the actual validate_and_write/run_once path — stronger, permanent confirmation than a one-off log line.

Task 4 — write_gate_failures.json scoped to url_liveness + cross_source_duplicate only (both showed a real structural, repeating pattern across runs; required_fields/format_compliance and not_duplicate excluded — 0 real repeat occurrences, different failure shape). Threshold: 3 consecutive same-check failures (vs. debate's 48) — justified as "dead-is-dead, no need for that much benefit of the doubt." On crossing threshold, the uid joins the existing excluded_uids.json (reusing the gate, not building a parallel one) and is logged to a new Excluded — Failed The Write Gate.md.

Task 5 — new tests/test_write_gate_failures.py (8 tests, pure-function + integration, including one driving the real cited SimplifyJobs:de926b0a-99e7-4dbd-94cd-334ec565be9f uid through to confirm it's excluded on schedule and never refetched after). Full suite: 444 passed.

Process note: Prompt 19 (parallel session) had uncommitted WIP touching the same files (run_pipeline.py/core/schema_drift.py/tests). Isolated via git stash on just the overlapping files, committed this session's own work (778f531), then restored Prompt 19's WIP on top — one merge conflict (both sides adding new blocks to the same spot), resolved by keeping both, full suite verified passing at 444 after.

Verified independently against the live repo 2026-08-28: local HEAD is 778f531, 1 commit ahead of origin/master (unpushed, as reported), full suite passes at 444 with Prompt 19's uncommitted WIP still in the working tree exactly as described.
```

### Prompt 19 — Codebase: Schema-Drift Coverage + Per-Source Zero-Match Alerting (written 2026-08-27, run 2026-08-27/28)
Full text: see the conversation (unchanged from its original write-up) — investigate Ashby's zero-match streak, extend schema-drift coverage to the 6 unwatched sources, add a per-source zero-match alert.

**Result:**
```
Full suite green (436 passed at report time). Left uncommitted (no commit requested) — later merged onto Prompt 18's commit by that session (see Prompt 18's process note).

Task 1 — Ashby's zero-match streak (115 runs at report time) is genuine, not drift. Live-curled all 9 ASHBY_COMPANIES tokens: all 9 return HTTP 200, valid unchanged schema. Exactly 4 real employmentType:"Intern" postings exist right now (Ellipsis Labs 1, Circleback 1, Cohere 2). Ran the real fetch_ashby/matches/compute_uid code against them: Ellipsis Labs + Circleback's postings pass every filter but are already in excluded_uids.json (permanently excluded after losing the debate comparator 48 times — logs/runs.jsonl shows the exclusion wave 2026-08-21→08-25, exactly matching when the zero-streak began). Cohere's 2 postings are both location: "Canada" — correctly rejected by location_eligible(). Two unrelated, correct mechanisms converging, not a bug. Task 5: no Ashby token needs refresh, all 9 live and correct; "~4 open roles across 9 small companies" (the 2026-08-24 finding) still holds.

Task 2 — schema-drift coverage extended to 5 of 6 sources: check_greenhouse_schema, check_ashby_schema, check_lever_schema, check_freehire_schema, check_ai_jobs_schema added to core/schema_drift.py, each checking one real, high-volume, live-confirmed company/slug per vendor (scaleai, elevenlabs, palantir, google) rather than every seeded token, to catch a vendor-wide field rename without multiplying request volume — each cites the real API response checked live 2026-08-28, targeting the specific fields whose silent rename would reproduce this incident (employmentType, text, enrichment.seniority, level). Added an allow_empty escape hatch after catching a real self-review bug: a company with zero current openings (hiring pause) would otherwise have been treated as "drift" and halted the run. InternDock got a different check (check_interndock_sitemap — confirms the free sitemap.xml still parses and still contains drop-shaped slugs) since it has no JSON API and its real posting shape only appears after a paid Firecrawl fetch of a page that might not even be a real drop — documented explicitly why a deeper check isn't meaningful there.

Task 3 — zero-match alert, threshold = 24 (one day of hourly runs) — chosen as comfortably below the 115 runs it actually took a human to notice, but long enough that a normal dry hour doesn't trip it. New update_/load_/save_zero_match_streaks in run_pipeline.py, persisted in state/zero_match_streaks.json: increments while fetch_count > 0 and filter_match_count == 0, resets on a real match, marks ever_matched (a source that's never matched anything doesn't alert — permissive by design), a fetch hiccup (fetch_count == 0) leaves the streak untouched. Fires once (==, not >=) via issue_fn, recorded in the run log (record["zero_match_alerts"]).

Task 4 — fixture-based tests added mirroring the existing schema_drift pattern (happy-path/drift/empty-allowed per source) in tests/test_schema_drift.py, plus new tests/test_zero_match_alert.py (pure-function counting rules + an integration test proving run_once wires it to issue_fn); tests/test_run_pipeline.py's shared _fake_http_get fixture extended for the 6 new schema-check URLs. Full suite: 436 passed (444 after Prompt 18 merged both sessions' work).
```

### Prompt 20 — Jarvis: New External Sources — Deadline Triage (Pasted Links + Job-Board Aggregators) (written 2026-08-28, run 2026-08-28)
Full text: see the conversation (unchanged from its original write-up) — deadline-triage ~40 pasted links + a PDF's worth of aggregator repos, apply the existing eligibility gate, dedup against the vault, `_Today/` or `No Deadline.md`.

**Result:**
```
Bottom line: zero postings anywhere in this sweep had a stated deadline in the 2026-08-28→08-31 window — all freshly-opened Summer 2027 postings, real deadlines found (Western Digital 10/20/26, Deloitte 12/1/26) are months out, most run rolling admissions with no published cutoff yet. No new dossier notes were created; _Today/ stayed at just No Deadline.md.

Step 1 (18 direct URLs): 17 real postings checked (2 already promoted to Programs/Serious/ — Nuro/Deepgram, found via dedup before doing deadline work). 8 passed eligibility with no deadline (linked in No Deadline.md: Deepgram/Nuro via existing wikilinks, plus Maximor AI/GlossGenius/Amazon/Apple/Whop/Ancestry as plain links since they have no existing dossier). 3 had a real deadline outside the window (Western Digital 10/20/26, Deloitte 12/1/26, Salesforce ~5/31 rolling). 2 skipped ineligible (Archer — explicit no-sponsorship hard reject; QTS ×2 — position closed). 4 unreachable (JS-rendered SPAs: Zipline, both Oracle Cloud postings). Tesla/Rippling deferred to Step 3 as instructed.

Step 2 (4 InternDock guides): none of the 4 expose per-posting deadlines directly — the two main drops only show "Summer 2027"/"Fall 2026" labels (rolling); the pre-internship/campus-ambassador guides show some dates but all outside the window and mostly fail the CS/SWE gate. Extracting all 650+ underlying individual postings was out of this sweep's budget — flagged as not reached, not dropped.

Step 3 (misc boards): all checked, nothing actionable — Rippling (403), Synk (joke posting, not real), dataannotation.tech (contractor gig, not a real internship), Tesla (403, event page not a listing), intern-list.com (link-hub, no individual deadlines). The Google Sheet URL given was a placeholder, never resolved to a real link — needs the actual URL to check.

Step 4 (GitHub aggregators): vanshb03/Summer2027-Internships confirmed already this project's live automated source (ingestion/sources.py) — not reprocessed. Checked table structure + grepped for "deadline/closes/due" across speedyapply (1526+ jobs), jobright-ai/2026-Software-Engineer-Internship, northwesternfintech, sharunkumar (6876 lines) — zero hits, no deadline column exists in any of these table formats, only "Date Posted"/"Age." Given the uniform pattern, didn't re-verify the remaining jobright-ai category repos individually — confirmed not reached, not assumed.

Not reached: individual postings inside the 650+/1526+/6876-row lists (would need opening each one), the Google Sheet (no real URL), lower-priority jobright-ai categories (correctly deprioritized per instructions).
```

### Prompt 21 — Jarvis: Existing Vault Dossier — Deadline Triage (All ~309 Live Dossiers) (written 2026-08-28, run 2026-08-28)
Full text: see the conversation (unchanged from its original write-up) — check every live dossier's stored posting text, live-check the fallback, sort into `_Today/` (copy, deadline match) or `No Deadline.md` (link, confirmed no deadline).

**Result:**
```
Total checked: 320/320 (live count came in higher than the 309 known at prompt-write time — 320 is current ground truth). Deadline-matched (2026-08-28→08-31): 0, across all 4 folders — nothing copied into _Today/.

No-deadline (confirmed, linked in No Deadline.md): 279 — 1-AI&ML 132/143, 2-Fullstack 32/43, 3-CyS&Finance 46/50, Other 76/84.

Dead-link findings (2, kept separate from no-deadline): Rippling's Backend-Focused SWE Intern posting now permanently redirects (HTTP 308) to Rippling's generic careers page. Several other fetch attempts came back blocked/inconclusive (Palantir/Lever, Belvedere/Lever, Mujin/BambooHR, Allegheny/BambooHR) but each also had no deadline in its originally-captured text, so filed as no-deadline with a caveat rather than as dead — a 403 isn't proof a posting closed.

Outside-window (real deadline exists, earliest Sept 1 2026): 41 total across all 4 folders — AI&ML 17 (Manhattan Associates, Deloitte ×2, KeyBank, Booz Allen, Honeywell, LPL Financial, Walleye Quantic ×2, JPMorgan Chase Quant Research ×2, JPMorgan SE Program, CACI, Fifth Third Bank, Castleton CCI Data Science, and others), Fullstack 10 (Castleton CCI ×2, Ameren, WEC Energy, Medtronic, Western Digital ×3, Google ×2), CyS&Finance 4 (KeyBank Data Intern, DTCC, Walleye Investment, one more Trading-adjacent), Other 10 (GE Vernova, Ameren DERMS, Amex Financial Crimes, WEC Energy Analytics, Moog, RTX, Regions Bank, Western Digital San Jose — confirmed live at 10/20/26).

Not-yet-checked remainder: none — all 320 accounted for.

Process note (real, caught and self-corrected within this session): partway through, the parallel Prompt 20 session appended 6 legitimate links to No Deadline.md for companies with no existing dossier (Maximor AI, GlossGenius, Amazon, Apple, Whop, Ancestry) — this session incorrectly treated those as erroneous noise (since they weren't among its own known 320 dossiers) and deleted them during a cleanup pass, alongside genuinely fixing 2 broken wikilinks and deduplicating real duplicates. **This was a real mistake, caught and corrected by the coordinating session on 2026-08-28, not by Prompt 21 itself** — the 6 entries were restored directly. Lesson added to the Prompting Guide: a session sharing a file with a parallel session must only ever append/fix its own entries, never remove something it didn't write on the assumption it's out of scope.

### Prompt 22 — Jarvis: New Internships Listings — Deep Individual-Posting Dive Into The Big Aggregators (written 2026-08-28, run 2026-08-28, continuation of the Prompt 20 session)
Full text: see the conversation (unchanged from its original write-up) — open individual postings inside the aggregator repos, keyword-prefilter, dedup, list eligible finds in `_Today/New Internships Listings.md`.

**Result — genuinely partial, correctly self-reported as such:**
```
File-state note: the session found New Internships Listings.md empty at start (a miscommunication, not a bug — the "External sources" content from Prompt 20 lives in No Deadline.md, never in New Internships Listings.md; nothing was actually lost).

InternDock Guide 1 (summer-2027-internship-drop-august-2026): scanned 125 of 136 entries in the "Software Engineering" section (WebFetch's extraction cap — 11 entries at the tail not retrieved; page has 650+ total across all categories, this was the SWE-tagged subset only). 36 distinct postings passed the keyword prefilter. 26 deduped away (19 already dossiers, 8 already carry an explicit exclusion verdict in Excluded — Losing The Debate.md from an 08-21 automated pass, Deepgram/Nuro already known-promoted). Passed and listed: Bank of America Global Tech Summer Analyst, Netsmart Software Engineer Intern, Netsmart Cloud Engineer (deadline unconfirmed, flagged for a spot-check). Skipped ineligible: GDIT ×4 reqs + Leidos (clearance), Cargill Atlanta (explicit no-student-visa). No 08-28→08-31 deadline found among any of these.

InternDock Guide 2 (fresh-internship-drop-summer-2027-fall-2026): fully scanned (only 16 keyword-shaped entries — a short curated list, not a large table). Deduped/excluded: Apple ×2, Amazon, Tesla, JPMorgan Chase, NVIDIA (wrong cycle, Summer 2026). Checked live and found expired: Platform9, Arcfield, Beyondsoft, K&L Gates. Passed and listed: Collaborative Drug Discovery — Software Engineering Intern. Not reached: Instacart (PhD-only, correctly would-be-skipped anyway), Nebius, Clinical Ink, AptaSentry, WhiteRabbit.ai — named plainly, not opened.

Genuinely not reached this pass: speedyapply/2026-AI-College-Jobs, speedyapply/2026-SWE-College-Jobs, jobright-ai/2026-Software-Engineer-Internship, and everything after — none of these were opened at the individual-posting level at all. The session's own recommendation: build a reusable dedup index (dossier folders + Excluded log) once, before the next pass, rather than rebuilding it from scratch each time.
```

### Prompt 23 — Jarvis: Deeper No-Deadline Re-Verification + Deadline Tracker + Dossier Corrections (written 2026-08-28, run 2026-08-28, continuation of the Prompt 21 session)
Full text: see the conversation (unchanged from its original write-up) — company-grouped re-check of the no-deadline claim, populate `Tracker/Deadline Tracker.md`, write `Dossier Corrections.md`.

**Result — genuinely partial on Task 1, complete on Tasks 2/3:**
```
Correction to the prior report: the real no-deadline count is 280 (126 AI&ML + 32 Fullstack + 46 CyS&Finance + 76 Other), not 279; outside-window is 39, not 41.

Task 1 — 44 multi-dossier companies attempted (covering 195 of 280 no-deadline dossiers, prioritized by dossier count as instructed). 0 surfaced a real program-wide deadline. 31 clean NOT-FOUND (real landing page fetched, explicit rolling-admissions language or no deadline stated: ByteDance, Virtu Financial, Belvedere Trading, Millennium, IMC Trading, Appian, Medpace, American Express, Akuna Capital, Hudson River Trading, TMEIC (no program page exists), IMC, Databricks, Fannie Mae, Zipline, Microsoft, DRW, Humana, Verkada, Pony Dot Ai, Deepgram, PDT Partners, Conagra Brands, Jane Street, Optiver, Vanguard, AMD, W.W. Grainger, Chicago Trading Company, Hewlett Packard (HP), Mujin). 2 low-confidence NOT-FOUND (Notion — page never actually fetched; Montenson — fetch actually hit "Mortenson," a different real company, see Dossier Corrections item 5). 9 blocked/inconclusive (403 or JS-rendered, never resolved either way: Palantir/Palantir Technologies — same company, split in two by the grouping, HPR, American Fidelity, Aquatic Capital Management, Jump Trading, AbbVie, Specter Aerospace, Copart, PIMCO). 1 unidentified: "Acds" — real company never confirmed. **Remaining unchecked: 85 companies / 113 singleton dossiers — not touched this pass**, correctly named rather than guessed into either bucket.

Task 2 — Tracker/Deadline Tracker.md populated with all 39 outside-window dossiers: 7 Already Over, 5 Soon, 1 Next Week, 9 Next Month, 17 in a new "Later" bucket added for anything beyond 45 days out (some into 2027) — the given 3-bucket skeleton didn't cover that range, extended rather than forced.

Task 3 — Dossier Corrections.md written, 5 cited sections: (1) 8 confirmed duplicate pairs (ByteDance ×4, AbbVie, Humana, one contradictory-sweep-note case needing a human diff, plus 2 title-pattern-only suspects flagged unverified); (2) systemic bucket-classification inconsistency (quant-trading roles split between AI&ML and CyS&Finance depending on keyword match; one standalone misfit, Business Systems Analyst Intern - W.W. Grainger, sitting in AI&ML); (3) 11 postings a human would waste time on (4 dossiers that only captured a generic listing page instead of the real req, 6 with already-lapsed deadlines and no staleness marker on the dossier); (4) 3 PhD-only/clearance-track roles flagged for a self-check; (5) the Montenson/Mortenson name mismatch.

Confirmed: No Deadline.md's restored "External sources (Prompt 20)" section was left untouched and verified present before this session made any further edits.
```

### Prompt 24 — Jarvis: Finish The External Resources Sweep — Every Aggregator, No Exceptions (written 2026-08-29, run 2026-08-29, continuation of the Prompt 20/22 session)
Full text: see the conversation (unchanged from its original write-up) — strict completion pass on all remaining external sources, every one gets a real checked-or-justified-skip outcome.

**Result — genuinely complete on its own terms:**
```
All 10 listed sources done, every one with a real evidenced outcome, no bare "not reached." 214 postings added to New Internships Listings.md this pass, deduped against the 4 dossier folders + Excluded — Losing The Debate.md (loaded once, reused all session) + the session's own additions. Per-source: InternDock Guide 1 remainder (11 scanned, 1 listed), Guide 2 remainder (5 scanned, 2 listed), speedyapply/AI (259 scanned, 69 listed), speedyapply/SWE (266 scanned, 61 listed), jobright-ai SWE+Engineer (153 scanned, 26 listed), jobright-ai Data-Analysis+Business-Analyst (139 scanned, 33 listed), northwesternfintech (71 scanned, 17 listed), sharunkumar off-season (831 scanned, 0 listed — only 3/831 rows even carry a 2027 term, all 3 failed eligibility), jobright-ai's 9 deprioritized categories (613 scanned via full-repo keyword check, not a sample — 1 real hit escalated and added: Hanover Insurance Compliance Data Analyst), the vault's own Research Loop - Resources.md/List/Resources.md (read directly).

Source 10 findings: confirmed the 9 sources this session processed sit correctly outside "the pipeline's 9 live sources" as the session understood them — **but that list itself was wrong and this needs correcting for the record**: the session's own enumeration (SimplifyJobs, JGCL, vanshb03, zshah101, Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, freehire, AIJobs) omitted ApplyGuy and InternDock entirely. **Verified directly against run_pipeline.py 2026-08-29: ApplyGuy has been a live SOURCES entry since Prompt 17 (2026-08-24)** — it is not a new candidate, and every ApplyGuy posting already flowed into the 320 dossiers this whole sweep triaged. The session's report was factually wrong on this specific point; corrected here, not silently passed through. **dreamworkhq/Tech-Internships-2027 remains the one genuinely real, still-never-evaluated candidate** — surfaced and deferred at least 3 times now (Prompt 17, this round) without anyone actually checking it.

One session self-correction, logged in the file: a wrong URL was transcribed for the Hanover Insurance entry, caught and append-corrected rather than edited in place.
```

### Prompt 25 — Jarvis: Finish The Dossier Deadline Reconciliation — All 320, No Exceptions (written 2026-08-29, run 2026-08-29/30, continuation of the Prompt 21/23 session)
Full text: see the conversation (unchanged from its original write-up) — finish the 113 unchecked singletons, resolve the 9 blocked companies via a different method, identify "Acds," reconcile the arithmetic.

**Result — genuinely complete on Task 1-3, plus a same-session addendum after the human paused the hourly pipeline:**
```
Corrected the actual singleton diff first (computed directly, not trusted): 85 companies/85 dossiers, not 113. All 85 checked this round, plus the 9 previously-blocked companies + Notion re-attacked with a different method (primary ATS listings — Greenhouse/Ashby/Handshake/LinkedIn — plus archive.org, instead of the company's own JS-heavy page). Combined with the prior round's 44 multi-dossier companies, all 129 unique companies behind the 280 no-deadline dossiers are now checked at the company-program level.

Result: zero new confirmed deadlines this round. Of the 92 company-checks: 73 clean NOT-FOUND, 9 BLOCKED (Allegheny County, Auto-Owners, Epic Games, Finastra, GuideWell Mutual, Marmon Holdings, Robert Bosch VC, Sage, Tencent — no company-hosted internship page exists or is reachable at all), 3 of the prior 9 blocked resolved cleanly (Aquatic Capital, AbbVie, Notion — via primary ATS listings), 3 resolved to NOT-FOUND only via secondary-source corroboration (Palantir, American Fidelity, Jump Trading — own sites stayed unreachable), 3 remain fully unresolved (HPR, Specter Aerospace, Copart), PIMCO stays unconfirmed (2 secondary sources claim Dec 1 2026, never verified against a PIMCO-owned source — flagged in Dossier Corrections, not added to the tracker on unverified secondary evidence). Net residual after two full rounds: 13 companies (~25 dossiers) genuinely unresolved at the company level.

Acds and Montenson resolved by reading the dossiers directly: Montenson confirmed a typo for Mortenson (the dossier's own body text and page footer both say "Mortenson"). Acds confirmed real — "Arkansas Center for Data Sciences dba Apprenticely," a real Arkansas work-based-learning intermediary; the company field names the intermediary, not the host employer (Naukr.AI / Caddell Reynolds) named in the actual titles. Apprenticely's own page checked directly: no deadline. Separately found acds.co (linked from inside the dossiers) currently fails with an expired SSL cert.

Two new sections appended to Dossier Corrections.md (6 and 7) with all of this; nothing overwritten. No Deadline.md/_Today/ untouched this round — nothing needed to move.

Same-session addendum, 2026-08-30 — the human paused the hourly pipeline to focus on promotion work: `gh workflow disable run` confirmed (disabled_manually), recheck (daily)/revalidate (weekly, read-only) deliberately left alone. Vault commit review used `gh api repos/gupta-builds/Jarvis/commits` (the local sibling checkout at projects/work/gupta-builds turned out to be an unrelated GitHub-profile README repo, not the vault) — confirmed the pipeline's own "Auto-discovered N internship(s)" commits are real and distinct from an unrelated cross-project vault-sync mechanism's "auto: HH:MM" commits. 5 new dossiers had arrived before the pause and were checked: 3 real deadlines found (Booz Allen ×3 — Charleston/Rome NY/Colorado Springs Data Scientist Intern, genuinely different reqs despite near-identical titles, all filed to Deadline Tracker's Later bucket at Nov 25/26/26 2026), 2 confirmed no-deadline (Intuit — clean; Mastercard — Workday page returned empty/JS-rendered live, filed with that caveat, same blocked pattern as other Workday postings this sweep). Both files append-only, nothing removed or rewritten.
```

### Prompt 26 — Batch Program + Contact + Tracker Notes — Deadline-Priority Batch A (8 dossiers) (written 2026-08-30, archived 2026-09-04)
Full original text:
```
**Fresh session**, `gupta-builds/internship-research-loop`. Read `CLAUDE.md` first, then invoke the `/promote-dossier` skill for each dossier below in order — don't build these notes freehand, the skill already encodes the real template contract, the contact-researcher agent invocation, and (deliberately, by this project's own design) a human consent gate before each write. Confirm the Jarvis vault is reachable (sibling checkout or `jarvis` MCP tools) before starting, per the skill's own prerequisite.

**Context — real, verified 2026-08-30, don't re-derive:** These 8 dossiers are drawn directly from `Tracker/Deadline Tracker.md`'s real, already-confirmed deadlines (built across Prompts 21/23/25's deadline sweep) — every date below is a real deadline read from the dossier's own posting text or a live confirmation, not estimated. Ordered by deadline, most urgent first:

1. `List/Dossiers/1 - AI & ML/Data Science Machine Learning Intern - Castleton Commodities International.md` — deadline 2026-09-01
2. `List/Dossiers/2 - Fullstack/Full-Stack Software Engineer Intern - Castleton Commodities International.md` — deadline 2026-09-01
3. `List/Dossiers/3 - CyS & Finance/Data Intern - Key Technology & Services - Data Track - KeyBank.md` — deadline 2026-09-04
4. `List/Dossiers/1 - AI & ML/Data Engineer Intern - Data - LPL Financial Holdings.md` — priority deadline 2026-09-21
5. `List/Dossiers/1 - AI & ML/AI and Data Engineering Summer Scholar Intern - Government & Public Services - Deloitte.md` — deadline 2026-09-24
6. `List/Dossiers/1 - AI & ML/A.I. Developer Co-Op (Boston, MA) - Manhattan Associates.md` — deadline 2026-09-30
7. `List/Dossiers/Other/Data Analytics Intern - Global Servicing - Financial Crimes Risk & Controls - American Express.md` — deadline 2026-10-01
8. `List/Dossiers/1 - AI & ML/Software Engineer Co-Op - Enterprise Finance Applications - Summer 2027 - Fifth Third Bank.md` — deadline 2026-10-09

**Efficiency note, real: two of these (#1/#2) share a company (Castleton Commodities International).** Do the real contact-research pass once per company where possible and reuse it across that company's dossiers — don't pay for duplicate research on the same employer's recruiting org.

**Scope — this builds Program + Contact + Tracker notes only (Internship Pipeline.md's Screen→Commit step), not further.** Reach Out and Apply are the human's own next actions once these notes exist — don't attempt to draft outreach messages or submit anything on an external site as part of this prompt.

**Discipline:** real research only, no fabricated fields (the contact-researcher agent already refuses to fabricate — trust that, don't override it under time pressure). The skill's consent gate is deliberate — go through it for each dossier, don't look for a way around it.
```

### Prompt 27 — Batch Program + Contact + Tracker Notes — Deadline-Priority Batch B (7 dossiers) (written 2026-08-30, archived 2026-09-04)
Full original text:
```
**Fresh session**, `gupta-builds/internship-research-loop`. Runs in parallel with Prompt 26 in a separate terminal. Same setup: read `CLAUDE.md`, confirm vault reachability, invoke `/promote-dossier` per dossier, same consent-gate discipline as Prompt 26.

**The other half of the same real, deadline-ordered list** (round-robin split with Prompt 26 so both sessions cover the full urgency range, not front-loaded/back-loaded):

1. `List/Dossiers/2 - Fullstack/Data Engineering Intern - Castleton Commodities International.md` — deadline 2026-09-01
2. `List/Dossiers/1 - AI & ML/Analytics and Quantitative Modeling Intern - Analytics & Quantitative Modeling - KeyBank.md` — deadline 2026-09-04
3. `List/Dossiers/1 - AI & ML/Machine Learning Intern - OpRegen Machine Learning - Genentech.md` — deadline 2026-09-08
4. `List/Dossiers/1 - AI & ML/Software Engineer Intern - LPL Financial Holdings.md` — priority deadline 2026-09-21
5. `List/Dossiers/Other/Technology, Operations, Digital, and Data Analytics Intern - Regions Bank.md` — deadline 2026-09-25
6. `List/Dossiers/3 - CyS & Finance/Infrastructure Engineer Intern [2027 Intern Program] - DTCC.md` — deadline 2026-10-01
7. `List/Dossiers/Other/Application Engineer Co-opIntern - PCS - GE Vernova.md` — deadline 2026-10-02

**Efficiency note, real: two of these (#1 here, plus #3 in Prompt 26's list) share Castleton Commodities International, and #4 here shares LPL Financial with #4 in Prompt 26's list.** These are running in two different sessions — check whether either company's contact/program info is already sitting in a `Considering/`/`Serious/` note or a Contact note from prior work before re-researching from zero.

Same scope boundary, same discipline, same report-back shape as Prompt 26.
```

**Result — corrected 2026-09-04, five days after the fact.** This entry originally had no Result block at all — the gap itself, not a declined consent or a bug. The session that ran this prompt (`08-30 Intern applications round 2.md`, 2026-08-30 19:46–20:19) completed Step 1 and Step 3 in full: it caught that the dossier paths in the prompt were missing the `10_Areas/Career/Internships/` prefix, re-derived the real paths, reused Castleton's existing contact research, and ran all 6 remaining `contact-researcher` agents successfully (KeyBank, Genentech, LPL Financial, Regions Bank, DTCC, GE Vernova — every one returned real, sourced findings). It never reached Step 2 (target-folder question) or Step 4 (the write) for any of the 7 dossiers: the human's very next message in that same session redirected it entirely to an unrelated task ("commit all the changes on this repo... push everything") — the exact schema-drift/zero-match-alerting commit (`2fa8b76`) — and the session's own auto-logged footer confirms zero files were created, modified, or deleted. Verified against live vault state 2026-09-04: none of the 7 existed anywhere in `Programs/`, `Contacts/Each One/`, or `Tracker/Each One/` (vs. Prompt 26's 8/8, confirmed in one commit, `84acd694`). All 7 promoted to `Programs/Serious/` in this same 2026-09-04 session, reusing the 2026-08-30 research rather than re-running it — see each note's own Conversation Log / Traps section for per-company caveats (2 of the 7 dossiers' deadlines had already passed or expired by 2026-09-04; both promoted anyway for the contact-research record, flagged honestly rather than promoted as if still live).

**Result — inferred from verified vault state, not from a first-hand session report (the actual per-dossier session output was never captured in this file — flagged, not fabricated).** Confirmed directly against the live vault, 2026-09-04: `Programs/Serious/` + `Programs/Considering/` hold 10 + 4 = 14 notes (up from 5 total promotions as of the last Monthly Review), `Contacts/Each One/` holds 10, `Tracker/Each One/` holds 10 — roughly consistent with most of the combined 15-dossier Batch A/B list having gone through `/promote-dossier` successfully, with a small shortfall between Program count (14) and Contact/Tracker count (10) that could mean either a few dossiers didn't get a Contact/Tracker note, or per-company contact-research reuse (Castleton, LPL) meant one Contact note serves multiple Programs. **Not resolved**: which of the 15 specific dossiers succeeded, which (if any) hit "nothing found" on contact research, and why Contacts/Tracker undercounts Programs by 4. Worth a direct per-dossier check before treating this batch as fully closed.

## Prompts 1-2 of the 2026-09-04 Era — Closed Out Without Full Execution (2026-09-06)
- **Prompt 1 (Building System Refresh, 2026-09-04):** Task D (the overdue Weekly + Monthly review) is genuinely done — see [[60_Claude/30_Reviews/Internship Loop/Scheduled/Weekly/Internship Loop Weekly Review — 2026-W36]] and [[60_Claude/30_Reviews/Internship Loop/Scheduled/Monthly/Internship Loop Monthly Review — 2026-09]]. Tasks A (status check), B (test parametrization), C (vault reorg), and E (public v0 README) were never executed. Superseded, not lost: B and E are folded into the new v0.1 execution plan ([[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Research Loop - Implementation Plan]]); C stays out of scope (vault dossier/promotion cleanup, explicitly deprioritized 2026-09-06); A (run.yml status) remains a standing human decision, not a prompt task.
- **Prompt 2 (Fix Microsoft `stage1_reject` Sidebar-Link Content Bleed):** never run. Its diagnosis was correct and is reused, unedited, as Prompt 2 of the new v0.1 execution plan — not rewritten, just renumbered into the new sequence.

Full original text of both, preserved verbatim below since neither actually finished (the vault's normal archive-on-completion rule doesn't quite fit an unrun prompt, but silently dropping real text isn't this vault's practice either):

##### Original Prompt 1 — Building System Refresh (as it stood in Claude Code Prompts.md, 2026-09-04)
See [[Prompt 1 Reboot - Building System Refresh Session (2026-09-04)]] for the full prompt — ground truth, non-negotiable rules, and Task A through E. Do not run Tasks C or D until their `[PLACEHOLDER]`s in that note are resolved. Task A is a status check only — re-enabling `run.yml` is explicitly reserved for the human and is not part of this or any prompt until said so directly.

##### Original Prompt 2 — Fix Microsoft `stage1_reject` Sidebar-Link Content Bleed (as it stood in Claude Code Prompts.md, 2026-09-04/05)
Handoff from [[60_Claude/30_Reviews/Internship Loop/Scheduled/Weekly/Internship Loop Weekly Review — 2026-W36]]'s Gate & Priority-Classification Conformance finding, per [[30_Order/Workflows/Internship/Internship Review System]]'s "Closing Out A Review's Findings" rule — a codebase-side finding becomes a Prompt entry here, not a hand-edit to the affected dossiers.
**The bug:** `Software Engineer Intern, AIML & LLM - Microsoft.md` (one of 6 flagged Microsoft dossiers, all genuine SWE/AI intern roles written 2026-08-21) is a confirmed `stage1_reject` false positive. Line 60 of the stored posting content is a "related jobs" sidebar link — `[Supply Chain Program Management Intern\` — not the posting's own description, and it contains the literal phrase `core/relevance.py`'s `_STAGE1_REJECT_RE` matches on ("program management intern"). Same bug class as the already-documented Google careers-listing-shell issue (`ingestion/posting_page.py`'s `_LISTING_SHELL_RESET_RE`) — a different platform (Microsoft's own careers site), same root cause: sidebar/related-content noise reaching `extract_content()`'s output.
**Task:** Extend `posting_page.py`'s listing-shell/sidebar-noise stripping to cover Microsoft's careers-site DOM shape (the same class of fix `_LISTING_SHELL_RESET_RE` already applies to Google), then re-run `revalidate.py` against the 6 flagged Microsoft dossiers named in GitHub issue #9 to confirm they clear `stage1_reject` on the real posting content once the sidebar noise is stripped. Do not hand-edit the 6 dossiers directly — they are genuine, correctly-written roles; the bug is in extraction, not in them.
**Not in scope for this prompt:** the other 9 dossiers issue #9 flags (Optiver, Zipline, American Fidelity, Amex) are real, defensible removal candidates per the same review — a Screen-pass decision, not a code fix, and explicitly left as an Open Question there.

# Prompt 1 — Company Registry: Collapse Three Unsynced Classification Mechanisms Into One (written 2026-09-06, run 2026-09-06, archived 2026-09-06)
Full prompt text lived in [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts]] (the "Second Reset, 2026-09-06" section) — required Plan Mode before any edit, given three files jointly decide real bucket/rank outcomes for live postings.

## The Plan (as approved)
Unify company-classification signals into `core/company_registry.py`.

**Context:** three independent files each hand-maintained their own company-name list, already drifted: `core/classify.py`'s `classify()` checked three regexes in a fixed order (AI/ML → CyS & Finance → Fullstack) with no company awareness; `core/debate.py`'s `_TIER_RANK = {"high": 0}` was a bare literal, independent of `core/profile.yaml`'s `preferred_companies`; `core/relevance.py`'s `_ADJACENT_FIELD_COMPANY_HINT_RE` hand-maintained 8 company names inline in a regex, unrelated to either.

**Direct evidence found mid-plan (`mcp__jarvis__vault_list` on `1 - AI & ML` and `3 - CyS & Finance`, 2026-09-06):** the prompt's own citation (Dossier Corrections §2) named 3 split companies (Optiver, IMC, Chicago Trading Company); directly listing both folders showed **8 real splits** — those 3 plus Jane Street, Jump Trading, Aquatic Capital Management, Walleye Capital, Millennium, each with real dossiers in both folders for the same kind of role. **User confirmed: fix all 8, not just the 3 cited.** Jane Street is also one of the 11 `preferred_companies` — this only changes its bucket routing, not its preference tier (separate mechanism, untouched).

**Registry shape** (`core/company_registry.py`): a plain dict-based module (user confirmed, not YAML) — `is_quant_finance_company()` over a normalized set of the 8 companies (reusing `core.identity._norm_company`), `ADJACENT_FIELD_COMPANIES` (the same 8 companies moved verbatim from `relevance.py`'s regex), `TIER_RANK = {"high": 0}` (relocated, not re-tiered). No branching/decision logic beyond normalized-membership lookups — registry is data, callers keep deciding what it means.

**Files changed, in order:** (1) `core/company_registry.py` (new). (2) `core/classify.py` — `classify()` gained a `company: str = ""` 4th param (default preserves every existing call site); checks `is_quant_finance_company(company)` before the three regexes, returning `("CyS & Finance", "quant/trading firm")` on match. (3) `core/debate.py` — deleted the local `_TIER_RANK` literal, imports `TIER_RANK` from the registry; both internal `classify(...)` calls updated to pass `listing.company`. (4) `core/relevance.py` — `_ADJACENT_FIELD_COMPANY_HINT_RE` now built by joining `re.escape()`'d registry entries; non-company industry terms untouched; the old redundant inner `\buhy\b` boundary dropped as a verified no-op (`test_stage2_rejects_real_uhy_content`). (5) `run_pipeline.py` — all 3 real `classify(...)` call sites (in `_prioritize_and_cap` and `validate_and_write`) updated to pass `listing.company`. (6) `tests/test_company_registry.py` (new, 5 tests). (7) `tests/test_classify.py` — new tests using real fetched content read from the vault for Optiver, citing vault path and read date. (8) Full-suite regression pass, with instruction to explicitly call out (not silently patch) any pre-existing test assertion that encoded the old bucket bug as expected behavior.

## The Execution Report (as delivered)
**`pytest`: 444 → 453 passed (9 new tests, 0 regressions, 0 skipped).**

**What changed:** `core/company_registry.py` (new) — `is_quant_finance_company()` (8 companies), `ADJACENT_FIELD_COMPANIES` (unchanged 8), `TIER_RANK` (unchanged `{"high": 0}`), reusing `core.identity._norm_company`, no new logic invented. `core/classify.py` — `classify()` gained `company=""`; quant-finance companies route to CyS & Finance before the three regexes. `core/debate.py` — literal replaced by the registry import; both internal `classify()` calls pass `listing.company`. `core/relevance.py` — company list now sourced from the registry; industry terms and per-company citation comments untouched. `run_pipeline.py` — all 3 real call sites pass `listing.company`. New `tests/test_company_registry.py` (5 tests) + 4 new tests in `tests/test_classify.py`, including two built from real Optiver dossier content read from the vault (2026-09-06).

**Verification against the report-back requirements:** 11 `preferred_companies` — `TIER_RANK` still one grade, `debate_compare` ordering byte-identical for all 11 (confirmed via `test_debate.py`, all green); Jane Street's bucket changes by design, its tier does not. 8 adjacent-field companies — every existing `test_relevance.py`/`test_revalidate.py` fixture citing them passed unchanged, regex content identical, only its source moved. 8 quant-finance companies — the override is a single company-independent set-membership check (no per-company branching), verified against real Optiver content (both the pre-fix and post-fix case) plus registry-level membership tests for all 8.

**Confirmed independently by a fresh session (2026-09-06, not just trusting this report):** `git status` shows exactly the expected files modified (`core/classify.py`, `core/debate.py`, `core/relevance.py`, `run_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_classify.py`) plus the two new files, nothing else touched; `pytest` re-run directly shows 453 passed.

# Prompt 2 — Extraction Fix + `matched_reason` Completion + Test/Doc Housekeeping (written 2026-09-06, run 2026-09-06, archived 2026-09-06)
Full prompt text lived in [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts]] — three tasks, `effort: high`, no Plan-Mode gate (none touched Prompt 1's cross-cutting files).

## The Execution Report (as delivered)
**Task A (Microsoft sidebar bleed) — fixed.** Root cause: Microsoft's `vanshb03` postings point at a generic careers-search URL whose shell uses a bare `# Jobs` heading and a `## Get personalized job recommendations` promo heading — neither matched the old `_LISTING_SHELL_RESET_RE`, so the extractor captured the 9-job sidebar list verbatim, including "Supply Chain Program Management Intern," tripping `_STAGE1_REJECT_RE`. Fix: two new narrow patterns added, cited to a new fixture (`tests/fixtures/posting_microsoft_careers.md`). Verified against all 6 flagged dossiers: 2 now extract clean, the other 4 correctly degrade to thin (no real per-job heading in their stored fetch, same precedent as Zipline) — zero false positives either way. Google/Zipline fixtures unaffected.

**Task B (`matched_reason` for all 11 sources) — done.** Added `matched_term_in_free_text()` in `core/filter.py` (refactored `_matches_free_text_source` to call it), wired real branches into `build_matched_reason()`. Found and fixed a real bug along the way: ApplyGuy's live "Not specified" season maps to empty `terms` (confirmed against the real Point72 dossier) — first draft would have emitted a malformed leading comma; fixed to emit the category alone. Real outputs, spot-checked: vanshb03 (Point72) → "Summer, Other"; zshah101 (Centerfield) → "Summer 2027, Software"; ApplyGuy (GE Vernova) → "Summer 2027, Software Engineering"; ApplyGuy (Toyota, empty terms) → "Software Engineering"; Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever/Freehire/AIJobs/InternDock → real matched terms, all "Summer 2027" on the live examples checked.

**Task C (housekeeping) — done.** `tests/test_schema_drift.py`: parametrized the 3 genuinely-identical families (46→30 test functions, 48 collected — unchanged coverage). Added a dated correction to the Discovery Step Postmortem confirming schema-drift is 11/11 since `2fa8b76` — `Source of Truth.md` was checked and doesn't actually mention schema-drift coverage, so no edit was needed there (a correction to the task's own assumption, reported rather than silently skipped). Wrote `docs/PIPELINE_CONTRACT.md`.

**`pytest`: 453 → 471, all green** (+16 Task B, +1 Task A, net 0 from Task C's restructuring).

## Independent Review (2026-09-06, this session, not just trusting the report)
Confirmed directly: `pytest` re-run shows 471 passed; every diff (`ingestion/posting_page.py`, `core/filter.py`, `run_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_schema_drift.py`) matches the report's description; the postmortem's dated-correction section is real, accurate, and follows the vault's own established correction pattern; `docs/PIPELINE_CONTRACT.md`'s workflow table checked against all 4 real `.github/workflows/*.yml` files, matches exactly.

**Two issues found that weren't in the report:** (1) the actual git commit (`96261d8`, local only, not yet pushed) bundles Prompt 1+2's real changes together with the entire pre-existing-uncommitted `.claude/` folder and a `CLAUDE.md` edit — material explicitly out of scope this round, now welded into the same commit as reviewed work. (2) `requirements.txt` gained `python-docx==1.2.0`, unneeded by any of Task A/B/C — almost certainly a side effect of the same bundling. Flagged to the human; not fixed unilaterally (a commit-history change, however low-risk while unpushed, needs a decision, not an assumption).

# Prompt 3 — Company-Research Cache (written 2026-09-06, run 2026-09-06, archived 2026-09-06)
Full prompt text lived in [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts]] — additive-only (`core/company_cache.py`, new), no Plan-Mode gate.

## The Execution Report (as delivered)
Built `core/company_cache.py`, standalone, not wired into any `.claude/` skill/agent or `enrich.py`'s call flow. Storage: `state/company_cache/<normalized-name>.json`, one file per company, keyed via `core.identity._norm_company`. Schema mirrors `enrich.py`'s real field names verbatim. `load(company, ttl_days=30, cache_dir=...)` → `None` on missing/corrupt/malformed/non-dict/expired — never raises. `save(...)` stamps `checked` to today. `is_expired(...)` is pure, boundary-tested at exactly 30/31 days. Docstring flags both ground-truth points explicitly (first per-key cache dir in the repo; a cache hit is a lead, never a substitute for verification). `demo()`/`python -m core.company_cache` runs a real save→load→backdate→corrupt cycle against a throwaway temp dir, verified not to touch the real `state/company_cache/`. `pytest`: 471 → 483 (12 new tests).

## Independent Review (2026-09-06)
Confirmed directly: `pytest` re-run shows 483 passed; `core/company_cache.py` and `tests/test_company_cache.py` exist and are still untracked in git (not yet committed — no repeat of Prompt 2's bundling issue); `state/` directory listing shows no `company_cache/` polluting real state (module correctly scoped to its own subdirectory, never touched during tests per the demo's own design).

# Prompt 4 — Investigate & Plan: Hourly Discovery Refinement + Manual Cold-Start Reseed Action (written 2026-09-06, run 2026-09-06/07, archived 2026-09-07)
Full prompt text lived in [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts]] — investigate-then-plan, Plan Mode required on both builds independently before any code/workflow file.

## Build 1 — Hourly discovery refinement: no code change
Read the Improvement Plan §3, the write-starvation postmortem (incl. both correction addenda), `core/debate.py`/`core/company_registry.py`/`core/identity.py`/`core/profile.yaml`, and checked the vault directly for `Excluded — Losing The Debate.md` (exists, 390 entries, all 2026-08-21 to 08-25, consistent with `run.yml` pausing 08-29 — stale by design, not broken) and `Excluded — Failed The Write Gate.md` (does not exist — the write-gate-failure-memory fix has test coverage but zero production evidence it's ever fired). Recommendation: leave `bucket_urgency` cross-bucket activation and `TIER_RANK`'s single grade exactly as-is — the former is explicitly gated behind `run.yml` being back on and watched (still disabled); the latter needs a `profile.yaml` preference judgment call only the human can make, not a code limitation (`TIER_RANK.get(tier, 1)` is already tier-agnostic). No code proposed for Build 1.

## Build 2 — Manual cold-start reseed: planned, then built
**Plan:** split state handling — `seen_ids.json` isolated (fresh, so the whole catalog is reconsiderable), `excluded_uids.json` seeded from real + merged back after, `debate_losses.json`/`capacity_notified.json` isolated and discarded. Write-cap ~100-150/run via an in-memory override of `run_pipeline.MAX_NEW_WRITES_PER_RUN`, no source edit. Cost estimate: ~100-150 Firecrawl calls, ~10-20 added minutes. Trigger: `workflow_dispatch` with a required literal `confirm` string, checked before checkout.

**Built:** `reseed.py` (orchestration, reuses `run_pipeline.run_once()` unmodified), `.github/workflows/reseed.yml` (`workflow_dispatch`-only, confirm-gated first step), `tests/test_reseed.py` (`_union_json_list`'s 3 branches). `pytest`: 471 → 486 (later 483→486 after the company-cache prompt landed in between). `RESEED_BUDGET = {"AI/ML": 40, "Fullstack": 40, "CyS & Finance": 40, "Other": 20}` = 140 total, matching the plan's range.

## Independent Review (2026-09-07)
Confirmed directly: `pytest` re-run shows 486 passed; `git status` shows only the expected new files, nothing bundled with the ongoing `.claude/` migration. Confirm-gate, budget override, and `excluded_uids.json` seed/merge all match the plan exactly.

**Two real gaps found, neither in the report:**
1. **`opt_cache.json` is never seeded from the real file nor merged back** — `reseed.py` passes `opt_cache_path=scratch_dir / "opt_cache.json"` (always empty) and the scratch dir is `rmtree`'d at the end. The plan's own reasoning for seeding `excluded_uids.json` ("skipping known-dead uids saves real Firecrawl calls") applies identically here and was missed — every OPT-excluded posting gets re-fetched and re-checked on the very next normal hourly run too, since an OPT-rejected uid never reaches `seen_ids`.
2. **`main()`'s actual orchestration has zero test coverage** — only the small pure helper `_union_json_list` is tested. `run_once()`'s existing dependency injection (`http_get`/`push_fn`/`fetch_page_fn`) was available to test the real merge-after-run flow end-to-end and wasn't used.

Follow-up: [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts]]'s next prompt fixes both, plus builds the "ready to screen" prioritized-dossier report ([[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Research Loop - Improvement Plan]] §4(b), previously scoped, never built) — made acute now that a single reseed run can drop 100+ dossiers on a human at once.

# Prompt 5 — Harden the Reseed Action + Build the Ready-to-Screen Report (written 2026-09-07, run 2026-09-07, archived 2026-09-07)
Full prompt text lived in [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts]] — fixed the two gaps Prompt 4's independent review found; no Plan-Mode gate (Task A mirrored an approved pattern, B was test-only, C was read-only/additive).

## The Execution Report (as delivered)
**Task A:** `opt_cache.json` now seeds from the real file and merges back via a new `_merge_dict_json` (scratch wins on key collision). Real merged output shown in the report — a pre-existing excluded verdict survived untouched alongside a genuinely new eligible verdict.
**Task B:** `main()`'s logic extracted into `run_reseed(*, jarvis_dir, real_state_dir, runs_log_path, now, ...)` — explicit args, mirroring `run_pipeline.py`'s own `run_once()`/`__main__` split. Found and fixed a real latent bug this refactor exposed: the old code permanently mutated `run_pipeline.MAX_NEW_WRITES_PER_RUN` at module scope with no restore (a real test-pollution/in-process-reuse hazard) — now save/restore via try/finally. New end-to-end test uses `run_once()`'s existing fakes. Break-it-and-verify done as required: commented out the `seen_ids.json` merge-back line, test failed with `FileNotFoundError`, restored, suite green again.
**Task C:** `screen_report.py` (repo root, matching `recheck.py`/`enrich.py`'s convention), reuses `scan_dossiers()` + `TIER_RANK`. Run for real against 6 live dossiers pulled from the vault. **Real finding:** none of the 6 (including Jane Street/Google, both `high`-tier) carry a stored `preference_tier` — the field is correctly computed at write time (confirmed in `vault_writer/writer.py`) but postdates most existing dossiers, so ranking is implemented but currently inert on the real corpus.
**`pytest`: 486 → 491**, all green.

## Independent Review (2026-09-07)
Confirmed directly: `pytest` re-run shows 491 passed; all 4 new/changed files present (`reseed.py`, `screen_report.py`, `tests/test_reseed.py`, `tests/test_screen_report.py`); `git status` shows only expected files, `.claude/` migration work untouched; `_merge_dict_json`/`run_reseed`/`OPT_CACHE_FILENAME` all confirmed live in `reseed.py` by direct grep. No issues found — this is the first of the five build prompts with a clean independent review on the first pass.

# Prompt 6 — Exact-5 Competitive Quota + Hard Capacity Pause (written 2026-09-07, run 2026-09-07/08, archived 2026-09-08)
Full prompt text lived in [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts]] — PLAN MODE FIRST (the highest-stakes prompt since Prompt 1, touching `run_once`'s live write-selection path directly).

## The Plan (as approved) — with two real corrections to the prompt itself
The executing session caught two errors in the prompt's own ground truth before writing any code: (1) "2/1/1/2 ≤ 3/3/3/1" is false — Other's new quota (2) exceeds its old ceiling (1); layering the new quota inside the old ceiling would make Other structurally unfillable and, under all-or-nothing, make every run write nothing forever. Resolved by **replacing**, not layering: `run_once` stops calling `_prioritize_and_cap`/`MAX_NEW_WRITES_PER_RUN` for its live path, calls new `_select_exact_quota`/`QUOTA_PER_RUN` instead; the old function/constant are kept, unreached, same precedent as `debate.py`'s own documented-but-unreached `bucket_urgency` stage. (2) "Exact-5" is wrong — 2+1+1+2 = 6, not 5. The per-bucket values (the actual confirmed decision) win over the round-number label.
Hard-pause check runs first in `run_once`, before schema-drift/any fetch (a local glob, zero cost) — checked-first means a paused run spends zero Firecrawl/API budget and never lets a partial write land the same run the threshold is crossed. `recheck.yml`/`revalidate.yml` untouched (they reduce the backlog, which works with the pause's own goal). Capacity-notification thresholds (`BUCKET_CAPACITY`, `GLOBAL_*_THRESHOLDS`) kept as an unchanged, still-real graduated ladder beneath the new hard stop, not redundant with it.

## The Execution Report (as delivered)
`QUOTA_PER_RUN = {"AI/ML": 2, "Fullstack": 1, "CyS & Finance": 1, "Other": 2}`, `HARD_PAUSE_TOTAL_THRESHOLD = 300`. New `_select_exact_quota()` (all-or-nothing, no reserved preferred-company slot, regression-tested for that omission). New `disable_workflow()` mirroring `file_github_issue`'s injection shape. `run_once` gained `quota`/`budget`/`disable_workflow_fn` params — `budget` is a genuine, disclosed collateral fix: `reseed.py`'s old module-global monkeypatch broke once `run_once` read params directly, so `run_once` now supports both an exact-`quota` path (the real hourly default) and an old-style `budget` ceiling path (for `reseed.py`'s cold-start use case, which needs "up to N," not "N or nothing"). `run.yml` gained `actions: write`. `Source of Truth.md` got a dated 2026-09-07 addendum documenting the reversal precisely (naming which of the two changes is actually the reversal and which isn't).
**`pytest`: 491 → 499**, all green.

## Independent Review (2026-09-08) — everything confirmed, first fully clean review of the whole session
Read every changed section of `run_pipeline.py` directly: the hard-pause check's placement, `_select_exact_quota`'s shortfall/all-or-nothing logic, the `budget`/`quota` mutual-exclusivity branch, `disable_workflow`. Read all 4 required scenario tests in full — each asserts exactly what it claims, including a test docstring that explicitly documents and corrects the "5 vs. 6" arithmetic error rather than silently working around it. Confirmed `run.yml`'s new permission and `Source of Truth.md`'s addendum directly (not from the report). `pytest` re-run independently: 499 passed. `git status` matches expected file set exactly, no bundling.

# Prompt 7 — Commit The Pipeline Work Cleanly, Leave `.claude/` Untouched (written 2026-09-08, run 2026-09-08, archived 2026-09-08)
Full prompt text lived in [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts]] — a git-hygiene prompt, not a code-change prompt; commit-only, explicitly no push.

## The Execution Report (as delivered)
4 clean local commits, exactly the planned grouping: `8186ea7` (company cache, 2 files/241 insertions), `193d5a5` (reseed action, 3 files/362 insertions), `775dbd2` (screen report, 2 files/140 insertions), `bee5146` (exact-quota + hard-pause, 4 files/369 insertions/28 deletions) — each with a staged-set confirmation run before committing. `pytest`: 499 passed on final `HEAD`. `.claude/` files confirmed identical (3 modified, 5 untracked) to before the session started. Nothing pushed. Flagged proactively: local `master` has diverged 5 ahead / 4 behind `origin/master` (4 daily `recheck.yml` auto-commits) — noted as pre-existing, not caused by this session.

## Independent Review (2026-09-08)
Confirmed directly: `git log --oneline -6` matches exactly; `git show --stat` on all 4 commits matches the claimed file sets and line counts exactly (241/362/140/369+28); `pytest` re-run independently shows 499 passed; `git status` shows only the `.claude/` files, unchanged. Each commit carries a proper `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5` + `Claude-Session` trailer. Confirmed the flagged divergence is real (`git status -sb`: "ahead 5, behind 4") and checked what origin's 4 extra commits actually touch: `logs/rechecks.jsonl` and `state/dossier_uids.json` only — zero file overlap with any local commit, so a rebase should be mechanically conflict-free. Second fully clean independent review in a row.
