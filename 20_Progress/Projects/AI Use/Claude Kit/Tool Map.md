# Claude Kit — second-brain-claudekit Tool Map

==This is the living map of everything ingested into `gupta-builds/second-brain-claudekit`== (`~/projects/ai/claude/second-brain-claudekit` in WSL) — one row per tool, updated the same session its pipeline stage changes. **This file gets a new or updated entry every time something new is ingested, tested, blocked, or promoted** — the same append-only discipline as [[60_Claude/20_Distilled_Notes/Sources - Plan/_Notes Created From Ingestion|_Notes Created From Ingestion]], applied to tooling instead of vault notes.

This tracks a different layer than `20_Progress/AI/Claude Code/<Project>/Setup.md` — those are per-project, hand-maintained inventories of what's *actually deployed* in a real project's `.claude/`. Most rows below haven't reached that stage yet; this file exists precisely to track the stage *before* that. See `second-brain-claudekit/_docs/Jarvis.md` for the full division of labor.

**Pipeline stages** (full definitions: `second-brain-claudekit/_docs/Architecture.md`): `sandbox` → `tested-tools` → `promoted (repo-scoped)` / `promoted (global)`, or `blocked` / `dropped` / `undecided` / **`parked (future)`** at any point. `tested-tools` is the current name — the repo renamed `tested-skills/` → `tested-tools/` on 2026-08-09; this vault's own vocabulary was still calling it `tested-skills` until the 2026-08-19 pass caught the drift, and this terminology has held correctly since (re-verified 2026-08-20 by direct read of this file — no `tested-skills` reference remains outside historical mentions of the rename itself). `parked (future)` is new as of 2026-08-19: a tool that clears `tested-tools/` review but has no current project need lands in `tested-tools/_future/<repo>/` with a `FOR-WHAT.md` naming the use case it's waiting for, per `60_Claude/vault-rules/pipeline-conventions.md`. Verified 2026-08-19 by direct listing: `tested-tools/_future/` is currently empty — correctly, not as a gap; nothing on this page has cleared review with no home yet.

**Verified 2026-08-20, against the real repo directly (`wsl.exe`, not the Jarvis mirror):** the repo's adversarial-review fixes — `claudeMdExcludes` extended to `["sandbox/**", "tested-tools/**", "instructions/**"]`, `_docs/Repo-Map.md`'s self-consistency, the `second-brain-claudekit` self-mirror removed from `instructions/` — are real. **Correction, same day:** an earlier pass this same round checked `git log`/`git status` directly and found the repo still uncommitted at HEAD `ef464d2` (2026-04-03), and reported that a claim of "committed for the first time since April" didn't match reality. That check was accurate *at the time it ran*. A later same-day check found the repo had since moved to **HEAD `9896d08`, 6 new commits (`ae3416b` through `9896d08`, all timestamped 2026-08-20 11:14–11:18 +0400), working tree clean** (`git status --short` empty) — re-verified directly against the real repo, not the mirror, not a report. The two checks aren't in conflict: a separate, concurrent codebase session made and landed these commits in the roughly 20-minute window between the first check and the second. The lesson isn't "always distrust a commit claim" — it's that commit state in an actively-worked repo is a moving target, and a claim should be checked at the moment it matters, not assumed to still hold from an earlier check in the same round.

**The corrected sync/pipeline model and a caught-mid-flight manifest fix (`b5cf0ed`, dropping `settings.json` and adding `README.md`/`_docs` coverage across all 10 manifest entries) are recorded as a dated entry in [[20_Progress/Projects/AI Use/Claude Kit/Log|Log.md]]'s 2026-08-20 "correction" entry** — includes two stale claims caught and fixed in [[10_Areas/AI/Setup/Folder Map|Folder Map.md]] (the sync rollout being partial, `agents/`/`commands/`/`hooks/`/`skills/` being empty staging), the sync task caught mid-failure (last successful run 16:00:03, a 16:36:56 attempt failed), and the mirror-side settings.json cleanup. Read that entry before assuming this page's pipeline-stage language ("live-synced," "staging") describes anything other than the current, verified state.

## Tools

### GBrain
- **What:** Personal-knowledge MCP with synthesis + gap-analysis (not just retrieval), PGLite-backed, no Docker.
- **Useful for:** Every project — Jarvis, BOOM, Portfolio, TradingView, CausalOps. A memory layer is not project-specific by nature.
- **Global vs. project-scoped:** **Global candidate**, confirmed — useful with no regard to which project is open (`second-brain-claudekit/_docs/Design.md`'s global test).
- **Pipeline stage:** `tested-tools/mcp-servers/gbrain/` as of 2026-08-20 — cleared `sandbox/`, VERDICT recorded, **cleared for global promotion** (not yet installed globally — see below). `bun install` (283 packages) → `bun run src/cli.ts init --pglite --no-embedding` → `doctor` reported **80/100 overall health, 100/100 brain score**, real PGLite database at `~/.gbrain/`.
- **Embedding provider wired and verified, 2026-08-20 (same day as the decision).** OpenAI (`text-embedding-3-large`, 1536d) is live. Real, undocumented gbrain bug found and worked around en route: `gbrain config set embedding_disabled false`, `gbrain init --embedding-model`, and `gbrain reinit-pglite` (gbrain's own documented switch path) all fail to clear a stuck `embedding_disabled: true` sentinel in `~/.gbrain/config.json` — root-caused by reading `src/commands/init.ts` directly; only a manual JSON-file edit clears it. Verified working with a real imported+embedded+semantically-searched test page (`gbrain search ... --semantic` → 0.8275 similarity, non-keyword-overlapping query — genuine embedding-backed retrieval), then cleaned up. Final `doctor`: 80/100 overall, 100/100 brain score (same headline number as the pre-embedding baseline; component mix shifted — the remaining ops-checks gap in both runs is an unrelated `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`-missing warning). Full account: `tested-tools/mcp-servers/gbrain/VERDICT.md` in the repo.
- **Promotion decision, 2026-08-20: cleared — global candidate.** All four `Promotion-Criteria.md` questions clear (see VERDICT.md); the Q1 "no workaround" answer is disclosed as partial (the switch bug above), matching this repo's own disclosure pattern rather than rounding up to a clean yes. Repo-side work is done; **the actual global `~/.claude/` install has NOT happened** — per `_docs/Design.md`, that's a separate session at the Windows/WSL home directory, not performed from inside `second-brain-claudekit`.
- **Displaces:** Makes `memsearch` (auto-capture, no synthesis) and `context-sync` (thinner SQLite memory) both redundant once adopted — see [[40_Resources/CS/Repos]]'s entries for both.
- **Paired with:** gstack's own `/setup-gbrain` command (below) — same author, designed as a matched pair, not two independent tools.

- **Real usage note (2026-09-05):** [[40_Resources/CS/AI/GBrain and gstack]].

### gstack
- **What:** ~34 slash commands + 55 generated skills (Playwright-based browse/design/PDF tooling), from the same author as GBrain.
- **Useful for:** Global by design — its own `./setup` targets Claude Code, Codex, Factory, and OpenCode simultaneously.
- **Global vs. project-scoped:** Global by design once unblocked. Currently project-based *only because it's blocked*, not by architecture — see `second-brain-claudekit/_docs/Design.md`.
- **Pipeline stage:** Stuck in `sandbox/gstack/`, **blocked**. `./setup` compiled the browse/design/PDF binaries, generated 55 skills (~893,538 tokens if all loaded at once), downloaded a 278MB Chromium build — then failed: `gstack setup failed: Playwright Chromium could not be launched`. Missing WSL system libraries (confirmed via `50_Claude/scripts/check_dependency.py --preset gstack` in the repo: `libnss3.so` missing, everything else present).
- **Fix required (not done, needs an interactive terminal):**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libnss3 libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libcups2 libdrm2 libxkbcommon0 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxfixes3 libxrandr2 libgbm1 libasound2
  cd ~/projects/ai/claude/second-brain-claudekit/sandbox/gstack && ./setup
  ```
- **Confirmed NOT registered:** `~/.claude/skills/gstack` and `~/.claude/commands/gstack*` both absent — setup aborted before its own registration step.

- **Real usage note (2026-09-05):** [[40_Resources/CS/AI/GBrain and gstack]].

### mattpocock-skills (`engineering/` category)
- **What:** 41 skills total (not the 18 originally assumed — a real correction from actually running the installer), fixing common agent failure modes. Only the `engineering/` category (17 skills: `code-review`, `tdd`, `diagnosing-bugs`, `implement`, `research`, `to-spec`, `to-tickets`, `codebase-design`, `domain-modeling`, `improve-codebase-architecture`, `resolving-merge-conflicts`, `triage`, `wayfinder`, `ask-matt`, `grill-with-docs`, `prototype`, `setup-matt-pocock-skills`) has been looked at.
- **Useful for:** Likely global (generic engineering-process skills, not project-specific), pending per-skill review.
- **Global vs. project-scoped:** **Undecided per-skill** — leaning global once reviewed, since nothing in the `engineering/` category is tied to a specific stack.
- **Pipeline stage:** `tested-tools/skills/mattpocock-engineering/` — cleared `sandbox/`, sitting in the second-look stage. Not yet promoted to any rigid folder.
- **Why not promoted yet:** The interactive picker (`bunx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills`) doesn't complete non-interactively, so the whole `engineering/` category was copied for manual review rather than cherry-picked live. `personal`, `productivity`, `misc`, `in-progress`, `deprecated` categories exist in the same repo and haven't been looked at at all.
- **Verified 2026-08-19:** still 0 of the 17 skills individually tested — `tests/skills/mattpocock-engineering/README.md` now tracks this as an honest, dated backlog table (one "Tested?" column, all `No`) rather than leaving it implicit. This is the real state, not a placeholder — confirmed by direct read.

- **Real usage note (2026-09-05):** [[40_Resources/CS/AI/Mattpocock Engineering Skills]].

### cpr-compress-preserve-resume (EliaAlberti)
- **What:** Three markdown slash commands (`compress`, `preserve`, `resume`) implementing the same Compress→Preserve→Resume session-continuity pattern second-brain-claudekit's own hand-authored `commands/compress.md`/`preserve.md`/`resume.md` already used.
- **Useful for:** Session-lifecycle commands inside second-brain-claudekit specifically — not a general promotion candidate elsewhere.
- **Global vs. project-scoped:** Repo-scoped (Jarvis-only equivalent, i.e. scoped to second-brain-claudekit's own session pattern), per its `VERDICT.md`'s `destination:` field.
- **Pipeline stage:** `tested-tools/commands/cpr-compress-preserve-resume/` — the first individually-tested, evidence-backed promotion decision in this repo. **Verdict: blend**, verified by direct read of `VERDICT.md` and its backing `tests/commands/cpr-compress-preserve-resume/2026-08-19-test-log.md` (a real transcript, not a description): cloned into `sandbox/cpr-compress-preserve-resume/`, installed into a scratch project, and exercised for real — project-root detection, session-log folder creation, the "summary-only, stop before `## Raw Session Log`" read contract (confirmed via `awk`, 26/29 lines), and the 280-line archive-budget check (`wc -l` → 8, correctly not triggering).
- **What was adopted into the hand-authored trio:** `AskUserQuestion` multi-select (replacing free-text prompts), `allowed-tools:` frontmatter, the concrete 280-line/archive-file budget for `/preserve` (adapted to archive into `60_Claude/Sessions/_archive/`, not the source repo's bare `CLAUDE-Archive.md`), topic-named session-log filenames, and `/resume`'s topic-keyword grep search.
- **What was deliberately not adopted:** `model: opus` pinning (this repo's other commands don't pin models), full raw-conversation logging (conflicts with this repo's "structured-summary-only" session-log principle), and per-project-root detection via `CC-Session-Logs/` (superseded by the fixed `60_Claude/Sessions/` path this repo already anchors to).
- **Old hand-authored trio:** not deleted — archived to `.claude/_archive/superseded-commands/`.
- **Open, not resolved:** this folder sits at a literal two-level path (`tested-tools/commands/cpr-compress-preserve-resume/`), not the three-level `tested-tools/<type>/<use-case>/<repo>/` convention `tested-tools/README.md` states elsewhere. Flagged inside `VERDICT.md` itself, not silently fixed — a future pass should either rename it under a `session-continuity/` use-case layer or amend the convention to allow two levels when one tool *is* the use case.

- **Real usage note (2026-09-05):** [[40_Resources/CS/AI/CPR - Compress Preserve Resume]] — also notes this repo has no `Repos.md` entry for CPR to cross-link from (it entered the pipeline via `Useful Repos - Shortlist.md` instead, never the master 95-repo index).

### Native-scaffold relocation (batch — 15 files, 2026-08-19)
- **What:** The repo's top-level `agents/` (4 files: `connector`, `researcher`, `reviewer`, `writer`), `commands/` (8 files: `brainstorm`, `capture`, `connect`, `inbox-process`, `journal`, `research`, `review`, `summarize`), and `hooks/` (3 files: `auto-link`, `daily-summary`, `post-note-create`) — all traced to the repo's very first scaffold commit (`d35f0b7`, 2026-04-03), confirmed zero external provenance by cross-referencing distinctive phrases against every repo in `sandbox/` and `tested-tools/` (zero matches).
- **Useful for:** N/A — parked as native scaffold, not a tool being qualified for use.
- **Pipeline stage:** Relocated to `tested-tools/{agents,commands,hooks}/native-scaffold/`, per Anant's `AskUserQuestion` decision to bucket them together rather than review individually. Verified by direct listing 2026-08-19: exactly 4 + 8 + 3 = 15 files present at those three paths.
- **Why this matters for the top-level folders:** their retirement (below) is a direct consequence of this relocation — both provenance groups that used to sit flat in `agents/`, `commands/`, `hooks/` (this batch, plus the CPR trio above) are now resolved, which is what let those folders be repurposed.

### ECC (affaan-m/everything-claude-code)
- **What:** Cross-harness agent operating system — 67 agents, 281 skills, 94 legacy command shims, hooks, rules, MCP configs, AgentShield security scanning, and a Memory Vault. ECC 2.0 additionally ships a Rust-based control-plane scaffold (`ecc2/`, in-tree, builds locally): terminal UI dashboard, SQLite session store, background daemon mode. Alpha quality per its own README, not GA.
- **Useful for:** Undetermined at the whole-repo level — real testing has started but the "does this close a named gap nothing else already closes" question (Promotion-Criteria.md Q2/Q3) hasn't been answered for any specific component yet.
- **Global vs. project-scoped:** Not decided.
- **Pipeline stage:** `sandbox/ecc/` — real `git clone` (2026-07-30, in addition to the pre-existing WSL clone at `~/projects/ai/claude/everything-claude-code/`, kept separate rather than reused, per this repo's own "nothing skips sandbox/" rule). `npm install --no-audit --no-fund` completed clean (210 packages — the repo is markdown-heavy, not dependency-heavy: 3 runtime deps, 8 devDeps). `node tests/run-all.js` (the repo's own documented test command) run for a real pass/fail signal.
- **Real finding, new to this pipeline:** merely cloning ECC into `sandbox/ecc/` caused Claude Code to auto-load its `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/*.md`, and register a `.claude/skills/everything-claude-code` skill into the active session — no explicit install step required. This means `_docs/Architecture.md`'s assumption that `sandbox/` is inert until deliberately run is **false** for any tool shipping its own `CLAUDE.md`/rules/skills — Claude Code's own config auto-discovery already "runs" part of it just by existing on disk inside the project. This was flagged for a correction to `_docs/Architecture.md`; confirmed 2026-08-20 that the correction landed — `_docs/Architecture.md`'s "Known, currently-unmitigated risk" section now documents this auto-load behavior directly.
- **Scope discipline (per Docs/Design.md, Implement > Knowledge):** ECC's catalog (67 agents/281 skills/94 commands) is large enough that wholesale install (`./install.sh --profile full`) would itself be the anti-pattern this repo's philosophy exists to prevent. The real next decision is which specific named gap(s), if any, ECC's components close that nothing already-adopted (gbrain, mattpocock-engineering, this repo's own `/challenge` `/ideas` `/strategy` `/llm-council` skills) already closes — not "install all of it because the catalog is large." Not yet decided.
- **Next:** Identify 2-4 specific ECC components (an agent, a skill, a hook pattern) worth reviewing individually against a real gap, rather than evaluating all 442 components at once.

- **Real test results (2026-07-30):** `node tests/run-all.js` — **3378/3388 passed (99.7%), 10 failed, exit 0.** All 10 failures isolated to two files, not scattered: 9 in `integration/plan-canvas-e2e.test.js` (ECC 2.1's browser-based "Plan Canvas" review feature — every failure traces to `connect ETIMEDOUT 127.0.0.1:21517`, a local detached server never coming up in this sandboxed WSL environment; looks environment-specific, same shape as gstack's Playwright/Chromium blocker, not a confirmed ECC bug) and 1 in `lib/dry-run.test.js` ("--dry-run works with implicit install routing" — `Expected exit 0, got null`, not yet root-caused). Per Promotion-Criteria.md Q1 ("did it actually run without a manual workaround") this is an honest **partial-yes**: the core test suite runs clean; one experimental feature (Plan Canvas) and one dry-run edge case do not, named and specific rather than glossed over.

- **What:** LLM Council as Claude skills (`aiwithremy/claude-skills-llm-council`) plus the original Karpathy repo (`karpathy/llm-council`). Both cloned so they can be compared side by side.
- **Useful for:** Undetermined — this repo already has a `/llm-council` skill; need a real gap check before any promotion.
- **Global vs. project-scoped:** Not decided.
- **Pipeline stage:** `sandbox/claude-skills-llm-council/` and `sandbox/llm-council/` — clone only (2026-07-30).
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/aiwithremy/claude-skills-llm-council · https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council

- **Real usage note (2026-09-05):** [[40_Resources/CS/AI/LLM Council Skill]] — documents the live skill these two were compared against and dropped in favor of.

##### last30days-skill
- **What:** Skill for researching / summarizing the last 30 days of a topic.

- **Pipeline stage:** `sandbox/claude-context/` — clone only (2026-07-30). Next: real install/run per Promotion-Criteria.
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/zilliztech/claude-context

- **Real usage note (2026-09-05):** [[40_Resources/CS/AI/Claude Context (Zilliz)]].

##### graphify
- **What:** Build knowledge graphs from content (code, docs, papers, etc.).
- **Useful for:** Marked **to use** — local skill already exists at `~/.claude/skills/graphify`; sandbox clone is for qualification before trusting/promoting further.
- **Global vs. project-scoped:** Not decided.
- **Pipeline stage:** `sandbox/graphify/` — clone only (2026-07-30).
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify

- **Real usage note:** [[40_Resources/CS/Concepts/Helpful Tools/Graphify]] (already live, pre-dating this clone — the round-2 sandbox triage below correctly dropped this `sandbox/graphify/` copy as redundant).

##### claude-code-best-practice
- **What:** Claude Code best-practice / learning reference guide.
- **Useful for:** Learning reference — not expected to install as runtime tooling.
- **Global vs. project-scoped:** N/A (reference).
- **Pipeline stage:** `sandbox/claude-code-best-practice/` — clone only (2026-07-30). Note: `_docs/Design.md` previously said reference-only repos stay out of sandbox; explicitly requested in on 2026-07-30.
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/shanraisshan/claude-code-best-practice

##### system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools + CL4R1T4S
- **What:** Large system-prompt corpora — compare the two for the best prompts when guardrail-bypass phrasing is needed for legitimate eval/red-team work.
- **Useful for:** Reference / prompt craft — not runtime install.
- **Global vs. project-scoped:** N/A (reference).
- **Pipeline stage:** `sandbox/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools/` and `sandbox/CL4R1T4S/` — clone only (2026-07-30).
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools · https://github.com/elder-plinius/CL4R1T4S

##### agentscope

- **Useful for:** Clone then implement against real use cases (not promote blindly).
- **Global vs. project-scoped:** Not decided.
- **Pipeline stage:** `sandbox/autoresearch/` — clone only (2026-07-30).
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch

##### TradingAgents
- **What:** Multi-agent LLM trading research framework (TauricResearch).
- **Useful for:** Trading / markets experiments; pair with OpenBB review for TradingView.
- **Global vs. project-scoped:** Likely project-scoped (TradingView / markets).
- **Pipeline stage:** `sandbox/TradingAgents/` — clone only (2026-07-30).
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents

##### OpenBB

- **Global vs. project-scoped:** Project-scoped (TradingView) if anything is adopted.
- **Pipeline stage:** `sandbox/OpenBB/` — clone only (2026-07-30). Large shallow clone (~345M).
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB

- **Real usage note (2026-09-05):** [[40_Resources/CS/AI/ECC - Everything Claude Code]] — also documents the 3 separate, unmerged ECC manifestations on this machine (WSL plugin marketplace, pre-existing clone, this repo's own sandbox clone).

## Sandbox triage — 2026-08-20 (the 17 clones that sat dormant three weeks)
Verified directly (`find <repo> -maxdepth 0 -printf` on every directory in `sandbox/`, plus a `node_modules`/`.venv` check) rather than trusting the "clone-only" label: all 17 repos from the 2026-07-30 batch still have a directory mtime of exactly 2026-07-30 and zero installed dependencies — genuinely untouched since the clone, not just under-documented. One-line decision per repo, so none stays silently unexamined:

- **agent-skills** (Addy Osmani) — **Drop.** No use case was ever named for it in three weeks; a generic skills collection with nothing to gap-check it against. Re-clone only if a specific skill inside it gets named as filling a real gap.
- **andrej-karpathy-skills** — **Drop.** Same reasoning as agent-skills — no named gap, never compared against anything adopted.
- **claude-skills-llm-council** + **llm-council** (Karpathy original) — **Drop.** This repo's own `/llm-council` skill is live and in routine use; three weeks with zero side-by-side comparison is itself the signal that this isn't a real priority. Revisit only if the existing skill shows a concrete limitation worth comparing against.
- **last30days-skill** — **Drop.** No named gap; overlaps with the already-live `/trace-topic` and `/ideas` skills.
- **spec-kit** — **Real next step executed, 2026-08-20.** `uv tool install specify-cli` (real, from PyPI) then `specify init spec-kit-test --integration claude --non-interactive` in a scratch project — real success, 10 skill files scaffolded into `.claude/skills/speckit-{constitution,specify,plan,tasks,implement,converge,clarify,analyze,checklist,taskstoissues}`. Not yet compared feature-by-feature against this repo's own (currently non-live) brainstorming/planning workflow, and not yet promotion-decided — just the install+init step Jarvis's prior triage asked for.
- **claude-context** (Zilliz) — **Real next step executed, 2026-08-20**, using Anant's existing Zilliz Cloud cluster (`in03-b8880982a4d3a16`). `pnpm install` + `pnpm build:core` clean; the real `examples/basic-usage` index+search run hit the cluster in `STOPPED` state on the first attempt (named, specific blocker, same discipline as gstack's Chromium blocker) — Anant resumed it, retry succeeded for real: **108 files, 1369 code chunks indexed**, 4 semantic queries all returned topically correct top hits (e.g. "embedding generation" → `packages/core/src/embedding/openai-embedding.ts`). Not yet promotion-decided; whether this beats Grep/Glob for real second-brain-claudekit work is still open.
- **graphify** — **Drop from sandbox.** A local `~/.claude/skills/graphify/SKILL.md` already exists (dated 2026-06-12, six weeks before this clone) — the sandbox copy is redundant with an already-installed skill, confirmed by direct listing. If the global skill needs updating, that's a direct edit, not a sandbox pipeline question.
- **claude-code-best-practice** — **Drop.** Reference-only, no runtime role, unread for three weeks. Free to re-clone at zero cost if a real need for it shows up.
- **system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools** + **CL4R1T4S** — **Drop.** Reference-only prompt corpora for a comparison that was never run; re-clonable whenever an actual eval/red-team need arises.
- **agentscope** — **Drop.** "Clone for study" only, never opened in three weeks.
- **promptfoo** — **Real next step executed, 2026-08-20.** Real `promptfoo eval` (via `npx promptfoo@latest`) against this repo's own `/challenge` command prompt, using `openai:gpt-4o-mini` (reused the same key just wired for gbrain, with Anant's explicit go-ahead) plus an `llm-rubric` grader: **1 of 2 test cases passed.** The failure is a genuine finding, not a fluke — the rubric grader caught that `/challenge`'s counter-evidence for a "daily journaling" test idea was generic rather than a concrete counter-example, a structural weakness manual review likely wouldn't flag. Real evidence promptfoo's automated grading adds something a skim doesn't. Not yet promotion-decided.
- **hiring-agent** — **Still worth evaluating**, tied to the real, recurring internship-research-loop use case. Next: run it once against a real internship search pass and compare its output to the current manual process.
- **autoresearch** (Karpathy) — **Drop.** "Implement against real use cases" was the original framing, but no real use case was named in three weeks; re-clone when one is.
- **TradingAgents** — **Still worth evaluating**, tied to the real TradingView project. Next: needs a TradingView-side session to pair it against real strategy work, not a second-brain-claudekit session.
- **OpenBB** — **Still worth evaluating**, same TradingView tie as TradingAgents — bundle both reviews into one TradingView-side session rather than two separate passes.

Net: 9 dropped, 6 kept with a named next step — **3 of those 6 (spec-kit, claude-context, promptfoo) had their real next step executed 2026-08-20** (see each entry above; none promotion-decided yet). `TradingAgents`/`OpenBB` remain out of scope for second-brain-claudekit sessions (TradingView-side). `hiring-agent`'s next step (a real internship-search pass) wasn't attempted. Dropped repos are not deleted from disk — "drop" means off the active evaluation list, not erased; delete on a separate, explicit pass if disk space becomes a real concern.

## Sandbox triage, completed — 2026-08-20 (round 2: the 15 clones the first pass didn't cover)
**`sandbox/` had grown to 32 clones by the time a concurrent codebase session re-counted, not the 30 the first triage pass worked from** — verified directly (`ls -d */ | wc -l` inside `sandbox/`, run fresh, not re-derived from any prior list). The first pass's 17 rows above are still correct and not redone. Of the remaining 15: **5 are already tracked elsewhere in this file and not "dormant" in any real sense** — `gbrain/`, `gstack/`, `ecc/` each have their own full section above with real, dated activity; `cpr-compress-preserve-resume/` already cleared the pipeline (blend verdict, promoted); `skills/` (mattpocock) is the source of the `mattpocock-skills` row above, with a real, honest 0-of-17-tested backlog already tracked. **1 is already resolved**: `memsearch/` was ruled out in `_docs/Design.md` (duplicates GBrain's auto-capture without GBrain's synthesis layer) and `sandbox/README.md` already marks it dropped — restated here only so it isn't miscounted as unexamined. **1 is a special case, not a tool-qualification candidate at all**: `adx/` is Ahnaf's real mentee project (`ahnafyy/adx`), not an external Claude Code tool — it has real dependencies installed and was reviewed twice in real mentorship sessions (2026-07-21, 2026-08-03, both logged in the main Session Log, not this file). Sitting in `sandbox/` is incidental; it was never a candidate for this pipeline and doesn't need a keep/drop decision here.
That leaves **8 genuinely new decisions** — matching the codebase session's own `_docs/Gaps.md` count of "21 dormant clones" (this pass's 17 + these 4 truly blank ones = 21; the other 4 below have real recorded intent already, so they don't fall in the same "dormant, unexamined" bucket the 21-count is about, but get real decisions here anyway per this round's "no clone left silently unexamined" standard):
- **gsd-core** — **Drop.** A meta-prompting/spec-driven-dev system, same territory as `spec-kit` (already kept, "still worth evaluating" above). Evaluate one spec-driven-dev tool at a time rather than carrying two idle candidates for the same gap — re-clone if `spec-kit`'s real trial turns up a specific limitation this would fix.
- **agency-agents** — **Drop.** A themed persona-agent collection ("frontend wizards," "Reddit community ninjas," "whimsy injectors") with no named use case — the framing itself reads closer to novelty than a scoped tool worth qualifying.
- **agent-skill-simplified-technical-english** — **Drop.** Empty `README.md` — no content to even establish intent from. Re-clone if a specific need for it is ever named.
- **Agent-Reach** — **Drop.** Gives an agent one-click internet/browsing access — redundant with the Firecrawl skill suite and native WebSearch/WebFetch already adopted vault-wide.
- **obsidian-mind** — **Still worth evaluating** — not blank like the four above, it already has real, specific intent recorded 2026-08-09 (directly cited as a model in Jarvis's own `Jarvis OS — North Star.md`), just zero execution in the 12 days since its 2026-08-08 clone. Next: read its procedural-vs-content split and five-hook lifecycle against North Star Part 5 and note what to adopt vs. skip — a reference-pattern review, not an install.
- **obsidian-second-brain** — **Still worth evaluating**, real recorded intent (comparison reference for this repo's own PARA-note conventions), same 12-day idle gap as obsidian-mind. Next: diff its vault-rules against `60_Claude/vault-rules/` once, note real disagreements.
- **claude-mem** — **Still worth evaluating**, real recorded intent (session/memory persistence) — but direct overlap territory with gbrain once gbrain's embedding is actually wired, and with the `jarvis-memory` MCP on the Jarvis side. Next: hold until gbrain's promotion lands, then re-check whether claude-mem still adds anything neither already covers — likely redundant, but don't drop before gbrain is actually running.
- **agentic-inbox** — **Still worth evaluating**, real recorded intent (directly relevant to Jarvis's `00_Daily/` capture-then-process flow). Next: compare its triage logic against second-brain-claudekit's own `commands/inbox-process.md` (already confirmed zero-provenance native scaffold, currently unused) to see if it's a real improvement over what's already there.
Net across both rounds: 32 total clones, 13 dropped, 10 still worth evaluating with a named next step, 5 already tracked elsewhere with their own real activity, 2 out of scope for this pipeline entirely (`adx`, and `memsearch` already resolved before this round). Zero left silently unexamined.

## Round 10 (2026-09-05) — sandbox re-audit; the 4 held-open items from round 2, resolved

Per `second-brain-claudekit/20_Progress/Projects/AI Use/Claude Kit/Claude Code/Prompts.md`'s Round 10 prompt — Round 9 (same day, earlier) onboarded Jarvis's 6 empty agents + `internship-research-loop`, confirmed committed (`git log`: `167d563`, `e2c27b9`, `0db6c75`, `491a0c6`, `e21ff9e`, all 2026-09-05; `git status` clean), and is not re-litigated here. `ls -d sandbox/*/ | wc -l` **still 32** — no new arrivals since the round-2 count above; nothing new to triage.

- **obsidian-mind** — reference-pattern review done, not an install. Read its five-hook lifecycle (`.claude/settings.json` + `.claude/scripts/{session-start,pre-compact,stop-checklist,validate-write,classify-message}.ts`) against `Jarvis OS — North Star.md` Part 5.3 (which already names obsidian-mind as the model). **Real match, 2 of 5**: SessionStart context-pack injection is built (`jarvis-session-continuity.ps1`'s SessionStart branch, staged into `second-brain-claudekit/hooks/Jarvis/` 2026-09-05 by Round 9) — reads as the same pattern as obsidian-mind's `session-start.ts`. A narrow, project-scoped precedent for PostToolUse frontmatter validation exists (`jarvis-internship-note-guard.ps1`, scoped to 5 internship note types only, not vault-wide). **Still genuinely unbuilt, 3 of 5**: UserPromptSubmit classify-and-route (obsidian-mind's `classify-message.ts` — nothing equivalent exists in Jarvis), a vault-wide PostToolUse frontmatter/wikilink validator (only the narrow internship-scoped one exists), and PreCompact transcript backup (obsidian-mind's `pre-compact.ts`; Jarvis's conversation-capture layer solves a related but different problem via `Stop`/`SessionEnd`, not `PreCompact`). obsidian-mind's procedural-vs-content split (`.claude/` vs. `brain/`/`work/`/`org/`/`perf/`) is already mirrored by Jarvis's own `.claude/` vs. PARA-folder separation — nothing new to adopt there. **Verdict: still worth evaluating, narrowed** — if picked up next, the concrete target is `classify-message.ts`'s UserPromptSubmit pattern specifically, not a repeat of this review.
- **obsidian-second-brain** — vault-rules diff done, real disagreements found, not a skim. Compared `references/write-rules.md` + `references/ai-first-rules.md` against `second-brain-claudekit/60_Claude/vault-rules/{linking-strategy,naming-conventions,tagging-system,write-contract}.md`. Real, adoptable gaps neither this repo's nor Jarvis's own rules currently cover: (1) an explicit anti-fabrication rule ("never claim absence from memory... false absence is the most common failure mode") — `write-contract.md` names no equivalent rule today, despite this repo's own `_docs/Repo-Map.md` incident log showing the same failure shape more than once; (2) typed relation edges (`relations: supersedes/depends_on/caused_by`, each with a stated inverse) — `linking-strategy.md` only has plain `[[wikilinks]]` + MOCs, no way to mark a directional relationship, even though this very Log.md's own "correction" entries are exactly this relationship shape today, expressed only in prose; (3) sentinel-safe regeneration markers (`@generated:start/end` vs. `@user:start/end`) for a note that's both machine-refreshed and human-edited — no equivalent convention exists here. **Not a gap**: this repo's own `write-contract.md` "Automated mechanisms must be failure-visible" section (5 named incidents) is more rigorous than anything in obsidian-second-brain's rules on that specific axis — nothing to adopt there. **Verdict: comparison complete, no promotion** — these 3 are candidate additions to `60_Claude/vault-rules/` or Jarvis's own write-contract equivalent, named here so they aren't lost, not queued as unrequested work.
- **claude-mem** — hold confirmed to still apply, correctly not re-opened. Its own recorded condition ("hold until gbrain's promotion lands") is unmet: gbrain is still not actually installed on either home as of this round — no `gbrain` on WSL `PATH`, no MCP registration in `~/.claude.json`, `~/.mcp.json`, or `~/.claude/.mcp.json` (checked directly), only leftover `~/.gbrain/` data on disk from the 2026-08-20 sandbox test run. No action taken — re-check after gbrain actually installs, not before.
- **agentic-inbox** — comparison done, real verdict, not a deferral, and it corrects this file's own prior framing. The real repo (`cloudflare/agentic-inbox`) is a self-hosted **email client** (React Router + Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects per mailbox, R2 attachments, Cloudflare Email Routing) with an AI agent that reads/searches/drafts/sends *email* — confirmed directly from its README and `workers/lib/tools.ts`. It has no note-triage logic of any kind. `second-brain-claudekit`'s own `commands/inbox-process.md` (`tested-tools/commands/native-scaffold/inbox-process.md`) triages *vault notes* in `00_Daily/` (promote/atomise/develop/integrate/archive/delete) — a different domain entirely. **Correction:** this file's 2026-08-20 entry's premise ("directly relevant to Jarvis's `00_Daily/` capture-then-process flow... compare its triage logic against `inbox-process.md`") doesn't hold up against the real repo — there is no triage-logic overlap to compare. **Verdict: drop.** Deploying it (a real Cloudflare Workers domain, Email Routing, Access) would be disproportionate to a use case it doesn't actually serve.

**Also found this round, a standing gap distinct from the above**: two `tested-tools/` items have cleared all four `Promotion-Criteria.md` gates but were never actually promoted anywhere — **gbrain** (cleared 2026-08-20 for global promotion, still not installed on WSL or Windows as of 2026-09-05, confirmed directly per above) and **cpr-compress-preserve-resume** (blend verdict, cleared 2026-08-19, the blended `compress.md`/`preserve.md`/`resume.md` still sit only in `tested-tools/commands/cpr-compress-preserve-resume/`, not in `second-brain-claudekit/.claude/commands/` — confirmed by direct listing, 2026-09-05). Both are ready-to-execute, no further review needed, just the actual copy/install step.
## Not yet in `sandbox/` at all
Everything else in [[40_Resources/CS/Repos]] not named above — still starred, still where earlier GitHub ingestion left it. Update clones with `second-brain-claudekit/60_Claude/scripts/update-sandbox.sh` (path corrected 2026-08-20 — the repo's `50_Claude/` → `60_Claude/` rename was fixed in the script's own comments back on 2026-08-08 but this note still pointed at the old path); inventory lives in `sandbox/README.md`.
