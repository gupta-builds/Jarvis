# What Agents
==Nothing has been promoted from second-brain-claudekit's sandbox into any agents folder yet — every agent below is either the repo's original scaffold or Jarvis's own hand-built five.==
## Promoted in claudekit
second-brain-claudekit's own `.claude/agents/` holds three, unchanged since the repo's initial scaffold (`d35f0b7`, 2026-04-03) — none came through the sandbox → tested-tools → promoted pipeline; they predate that pipeline entirely.
- **vault-curator** — keeps that repo's own PARA notes linked, clean, deduplicated.
- **research-distiller** — turns rough captures into compact evergreen notes inside that repo.
- **weekly-reviewer** — runs its end-of-week review and writes the weekly summary.
**As of 2026-08-19, the top-level `agents/` folder is empty**, verified by direct listing, not carried over from the old description. It used to hold four flat drafts (`connector.md`, `researcher.md`, `reviewer.md`, `writer.md`, all traced to the repo's first scaffold commit `d35f0b7`); those were confirmed zero-provenance (no match against any repo in `sandbox/` or `tested-tools/`) and relocated to `tested-tools/agents/native-scaffold/` — see [[20_Progress/Projects/AI Use/Claude Kit/Tool Map|Tool Map]]'s native-scaffold batch row. `agents/` is no longer a flat draft-then-promote staging area at all; it's now per-destination-project staging (`agents/<ProjectName>/`, created only when real content lands for that project — per `60_Claude/vault-rules/pipeline-conventions.md`). See [[20_Progress/Projects/AI Use/Claude Kit/Toolkit/Agents/How to Use Agents|How to Use Agents]] for what that means in practice.
## Live in Jarvis
Verified against `.claude/agents/` at the vault root, not the 2026-07-05 snapshot in `20_Progress/AI/Claude Code/Jarvis/`, which [[20_Progress/AI/Claude Code/MOC]] already flags stale. Five agents, all Jarvis-native — none sourced from claudekit's sandbox:
- **research-distiller** — deep source ingestion; the only agent with Bash + WebFetch access.
- **anti-slop-editor** — rewrites AI-sounding prose per [[HUMAN_WRITING]].
- **vault-curator** — link, duplicate, and frontmatter health, report-first.
- **learning-agent** — spaced-repetition drills over Capability Engine fields.
- **career-operator** — internship, resume, and mentorship briefs.
Jarvis's `research-distiller` and `vault-curator` share a name with claudekit's promoted pair above but are independently built — same job description, no shared code, confirmed by reading both files directly.
## External projects
**New 2026-09-06 — a third layer beyond "Promoted in claudekit" and "Live in Jarvis" above.** Real, external Claude Code projects get their own inventory note here once reviewed in depth, starting with [[20_Progress/Projects/AI Use/Claude Kit/Toolkit/Agents/internship-research-loop|internship-research-loop]] — 7 agents, all read directly from the live repo, none declaring a `memory` field yet. More will follow the same pattern; not yet interlinked further while that build-out is in progress.
