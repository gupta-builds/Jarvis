# What Hooks
==Only one of Jarvis's two documented hooks is actually registered right now — verified by reading .claude/settings.json directly, not by trusting the note that describes it.==
## Promoted in claudekit
second-brain-claudekit's `.claude/hooks/`, both wired in its `settings.json`, both confirmed present as `.ps1` files with `.md` companion docs.
- **after-edit-log.ps1** — `PostToolUse` (`Write|Edit|MultiEdit`) — appends a log line to `60_Claude/Sessions/_today-edits.md` on every edit.
- **session-wrapup.ps1** — `Stop` — reminds to run `/compress` if no session log was written that session.
Both were the source of a real incident (`_docs/Repo-Map.md`'s "50_Claude recreation bug") — hardcoded a pre-rename path, silently recreated a deleted folder the moment the hook re-armed after a git restore. Fixed 2026-08-08. Worth remembering when writing any hook here: a hardcoded path survives a folder rename as a silent bug, not a loud one.
**As of 2026-08-19, the top-level `hooks/` folder is empty**, verified by direct listing. Its three original files (`auto-link.md`, `daily-summary.md`, `post-note-create.md`, all traced to the first scaffold commit `d35f0b7`) were confirmed zero-provenance and relocated to `tested-tools/hooks/native-scaffold/` — see [[20_Progress/Projects/AI Use/Claude Kit/Tool Map|Tool Map]]'s native-scaffold batch row. `hooks/` is now per-destination-project staging (`hooks/<ProjectName>/`, created only when real content lands for that project), not a flat draft area.
## Live in Jarvis
Verified directly against `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` at the vault root, not against `10_Areas/AI/Claude Code.md`'s table, which claims two wired hooks — that claim is only half true right now.
- **jarvis-write-guard.ps1** — `PreToolUse` (`Write|Edit|MultiEdit`) — **actually registered**, confirmed in `.claude/settings.json`. Enforces the Write Contract: denies vault-root files, `50_Archive/`, `.obsidian/`, `05_Clippings/`, `.cursor/`, `.kiro/`, `.git/`; allowlists daily-ops paths. Fails open on a JSON parse error.
- **jarvis-session-continuity.ps1** — exists on disk at `30_Order/System/claude-workflow/hooks/jarvis-session-continuity.ps1`, documented as injecting context at `SessionStart` and continuity at `SessionEnd` — **not present in either settings file**, so it does not currently run. This is a real, current gap, not a documentation nitpick — the "morning context assembly" behavior several notes describe as automatic is not happening via this mechanism today.
## External projects
**New 2026-09-06 — a third layer beyond "Promoted in claudekit" and "Live in Jarvis" above.** Real, external Claude Code projects get their own inventory note here once reviewed in depth, starting with [[20_Progress/Projects/AI Use/Claude Kit/Toolkit/Hooks/internship-research-loop|internship-research-loop]] — 2 real hooks (bash, advisory-only, fail-open), both read directly from the live repo. More will follow the same pattern; not yet interlinked further while that build-out is in progress.
