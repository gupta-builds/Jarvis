# Mock Alert Lifecycle

This is a simplified, teaching-oriented walkthrough of one alert moving through BOOM.

## Scenario

Imagine ZTF observes a patch of sky and detects a brightness change.

The survey emits an alert packet containing:

- object ID
- candidate ID
- RA/Dec
- photometric measurements
- cutout images

## Step 1: Kafka input

The survey alert enters a Kafka topic.

Meaning:

- the alert is now part of a stream
- BOOM can subscribe to and consume it

## Step 2: Kafka consumer

BOOM's Kafka consumer reads the packet and pushes it into Redis or Valkey.

Meaning:

- BOOM has accepted the alert into its internal processing system

## Step 3: Alert worker

The alert worker:

- parses and normalizes the packet
- writes initial alert/object/image records to MongoDB
- pushes the candidate ID into the enrichment queue

Meaning:

- the alert now exists as structured BOOM data, not just an external packet

## Step 4: Enrichment worker

The enrichment worker:

- loads the relevant alert data
- cross-matches against catalogs
- computes or stores model scores
- writes new fields back to MongoDB
- pushes the candidate ID into the filter queue

Meaning:

- the alert has more scientific and operational context than the raw packet had

## Step 5: Filter worker

The filter worker:

- loads the enriched record
- runs user-defined filter logic
- if the alert passes, emits it to an output stream

Meaning:

- BOOM has now decided whether the alert is interesting for downstream consumers

## Step 6: API and downstream access

At this point, users or systems can:

- query BOOM through the API
- consume filtered alerts from output topics
- inspect the processed record in MongoDB

## What This Walkthrough Teaches

- one alert turns into multiple internal records and processing stages
- Kafka is not the whole story
- MongoDB is not just storage; it supports downstream enrichment and filtering
- BOOM's value comes from transforming raw signals into usable scientific candidates
