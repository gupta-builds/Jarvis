When you pass **any array** (static or dynamic) to a function, what actually gets passed is **just the base address** (pointer to element 0). The function gets a copy of the base address → `arr` points to the same heap block.
```
void init_array(int *arr, int size);
void init_array(int arr[], int size);
```
Are completely equivalent declarations because arrays always decay to pointers when passed to functions.
