# GitHub Stars Index
Organized by GitHub list. Each section mirrors the star list on [gupta-builds's profile](https://github.com/gupta-builds?tab=stars).
==**Implement > Knowledge (2026-07-29):** install only what closes a named gap or unlocks a blocked project; reference everything else via the Awesome-index repos before building from scratch; test in one session before committing.== Source: [[PDF's Ingestion Implementation#Claude Code Skills & Repos: Implement vs. Knowledge Matrix - REVIEW|Claude Code Skills & Repos Matrix]], confirmed by [[00_Execution]]'s GitHub pass — neither this doc's annotations nor the companion [[How Anant Uses Each Repo]] had actually been executed three weeks after being written. Markers below now record real decisions (`(*INSTALL: QUEUED*)`, `(*SKIP*)`, `(*EVAL: DATE*)`, `(*DEFERRED*)`) instead of open questions — "QUEUED" means decided but not yet run, not installed. Full per-repo reasoning: [[00_Execution#Github|00_Execution § Github]].
Every repo below now also carries a `→` marker to its individual deep-dive note in `60_Claude/10_Source_Summaries/Github Ingestion/` where one exists, or `→ no relations` where the repo was starred but never individually ingested.
## Claude (23)
Claude Code tooling, memory, agent infrastructure.
### Skills & Agents
- [ECC](https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC) — agent harness for Claude Code: skills, instincts, persistent memory, and a security layer in a single install (*RE-CORRECTED: 2026-07-30 — the 2026-07-29 "unrelated Rust project" call on `ecc2` was itself wrong: `git remote -v` confirms `ecc2` is `affaan-m/everything-claude-code`'s own in-tree ECC 2.0 Rust control-plane scaffold (`git ls-files` confirms it's tracked, not a stray clone), not an unrelated repo. Real testing has now happened: cloned into `second-brain-claudekit/sandbox/ecc/`, `npm install` clean (210 packages), full test suite run — 3378/3388 passing (99.7%), 10 failures isolated to the experimental Plan Canvas feature (environment-specific `ETIMEDOUT`, likely this sandbox's networking, not a confirmed ECC bug) and one dry-run edge case. Catalog is large (67 agents/281 skills/94 commands) — per Implement > Knowledge, still deciding which specific named gap(s) it closes rather than installing wholesale; cross-harness-portability angle evaluated 2026-07-30, see [[Tool Map]]*) → [[ECC]]
- [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) — 13 cognitive-mode skills (founder review, eng review, paranoid QA) plus a Playwright browser for Claude Code (*BLOCKED: 2026-07-29 — cloned + `./setup` run for real in `second-brain-claudekit/sandbox`; now 55 skills (~893K tokens), compiled fine, but fails at Chromium launch (missing WSL system libs, needs interactive `sudo apt install`); nothing registered yet — see [[Claude Kit Implementation]]*) → [[gstack]]
- [Skills (mattpocock)](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) — 18 skills targeting the four main agent failure modes: misalignment, verbosity, broken feedback loops, entropy. (*PARTIAL: 2026-07-29 — now 41 skills; `engineering/` category (17 skills) copied into `second-brain-claudekit/tested-skills/` for review, not yet promoted to global — see [[Claude Kit Implementation]]*) → [[mattpocock-skills]]

- [Ruflo](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo) — multi-agent orchestration with Q-Learning routing, 60+ specialized agents, and swarm coordination (*DEFERRED: 2026-07-29 — Claude Code's native subagent tooling + ECC 2.0's worktree-lifecycle service cover the real near-term need; revisit once true concurrent-agent work exists*) → [[ruflo]]
- [Agency Agents](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents) — 105K-star complete AI agency in your .claude: frontend wizard, Reddit ninja, whimsy injector, reality checker - ==not written== → [[agency-agents]]

Use for hard decisions. Multiple resources listed in vault. (*BUILT: 2026-07-29 — installed as `.claude/skills/llm-council.md`, see [[Claude Council (LLM Council Skill Install)]]*) → [[LLM Council skills]], [[Claude Council (LLM Council Skill Install)]]
- [Last 30 Days Skill](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill) — Claude Code skill that searches for information from the last 30 days. (*COPY: QUEUED — recency-biased search across Reddit/X/YouTube/HN/Polymarket in one pass, install for the trading research workflow*) → [[last30days-skill]]

- [Polymarket MCP](https://github.com/caiovicentino/polymarket-mcp-server) — 45-tool MCP for Claude Desktop via Polymarket's CLOB API; demo mode read-only; full mode requires polygon wallet and unavailable to US persons under ToS. (*REFERENCE ONLY: 2026-07-29 — demo-mode confirmed correctly scoped; use as the architecture reference for a read-only market-data MCP against TradingView's own providers, don't install live for actual trading*) → [[polymarket-mcp-server]]

# Removed
Repos decided against, reasoned per entry — either genuinely not useful, or fully redundant with something already adopted (a "drained" repo: everything worth extracting from it already has been, and it does nothing further for an active project). Full reasoning for the GitHub pass overall lives in [[60_Claude/20_Distilled_Notes/Sources - Plan/00_Execution#Github|00_Execution § Github]].
**Already self-marked *not useful* — confirmed, no re-litigation:** Claude Code Templates (redundant with the plugin marketplaces now used directly), Dify (team-scale infra, not solo tooling), React Three Fiber, Modern JS Cheatsheet, ProjectLearn, Free Programming Books, Ghostty Blackhole, Mike, Paperclip, Jarvis (ethanplusai, macOS-only), Semantic Search Starter, Pretext.
**Dropped this pass, with reason:**
- **GitNexus** — dropped per your own header tag on [[PDF's Ingestion Implementation]]; CausalOps's own graphify report already gives blast-radius visibility, no second tool needed.
- **Free Claude Code** — proxy fallback to NVIDIA NIM/OpenRouter for quota exhaustion; not needed with an active Claude subscription.
- **jcode** — README was empty at time of review; can't evaluate, nothing to fork.
- **Odysseus** — self-hosted AI workspace (chat/agents/research/email/calendar); fully redundant with Jarvis + gbrain + the ECC harness already being adopted — a second personal-AI-workspace platform fragments rather than helps.
- **OpenHuman** — same reasoning as Odysseus: a second "private personal AI assistant" framework competes with, rather than extends, Jarvis + gbrain + jarvis-memory. Drop, not build a parallel system.
- **Hiring Agent** — this is a tool for companies *running* technical interviews (HackerRank), not for a candidate taking them; no application to Anant's own job search.
- **Obsidian Dashboard** (community template) — redundant now that Jarvis's own dashboard is a custom DataviewJS build already ahead of a generic template.
- **ScrapeGraph-ai, Scrapling** — both redundant with Firecrawl, which is already integrated as a full skill suite (18+ firecrawl skills active) and covers the same scraping need with a working install, not a hypothetical one.
- **Crawl4AI** — same reasoning: redundant scraping framework, Firecrawl already does this.
- **ASI-Evolve, dots.ocr, AirLLM** — local-model/research-artifact tools with no active use case while on a Claude subscription with no local-inference workflow yet; drained of near-term relevance, not of quality.

# Real usage notes (added 2026-09-05, second-brain-claudekit Round 10)

Cross-links to real "how Anant actually uses this now" notes, added alongside (not replacing) each repo's existing `→` deep-dive link above — these document actual install state, real commands, and current workflow use, written after the tool was actually run through `second-brain-claudekit`'s pipeline. Not added inline on each bullet above to avoid touching this file's dense, CRLF-formatted per-repo lines by partial-string edit; listed here instead, same `→` convention:

- **CPR (Compress/Preserve/Resume)** — no entry exists on this page for it (confirmed by direct search, 2026-09-05); it only appears in [[Useful Repos - Shortlist]], now retired — see [[40_Resources/CS/AI/CPR - Compress Preserve Resume]] for its real usage note directly.
