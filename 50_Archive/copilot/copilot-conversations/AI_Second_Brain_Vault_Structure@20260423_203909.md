**user**: I am just in general curious to what you think about this ai powered second brain. I have created a good folder structure for this vault but i have also created a copy of this vault called jarvis. Which i thought to completely upgrade using ai. That's a vault that i would want to fully optimize using ai. But i want a really good plan before i go ahead and ask ai to make this second brain to more powerful. I have already tried to implement this structure using codex and claude code slightly. There is certainly a lot of ai written information in this vault already. I am trying to keep that to a minimum. But what i want to achieve here is this really insane second brain sort of tool that has all conversations with my ai, mcp connecters, extensions, etc. Really completely ai powered in such a way that i am getting much more new knowledge from that vault. I want to use that vault in such a manner that everything that ai is written. I will refine it, improve it and then write it into this vault. I need you to think about exactly what i have described over here. Search the internet about this and tell me how i can implement this.

**ai**: Your direction makes sense: keep your current vault as the “clean, curated brain,” and use **Jarvis** as the “AI-augmented lab” where automation, connectors, and AI-generated drafts happen first—then you intentionally promote only the refined outputs back into the main vault. The key is to design Jarvis so it produces *reviewable artifacts* (summaries, diffs, proposals, links), not a flood of untrusted text.[^1]

## What I think is the right architecture (so it becomes “insane” but not messy)
### 1) Don’t build one giant agent—build layered roles
You already have the right mental model in your notes: a **layered setup** where tools have roles (private/local vs coding vs escalation). This prevents tool overload and keeps the system reliable.[^2]

- **Layer A: Private/local brain (Ollama)**  
  Use it for private note processing, extracting patterns, summarizing, and preparing prompts—especially where you don’t want data leaving your machine.[^2]
- **Layer B: Coding hands (Cursor/Copilot)**  
  Use repo-aware editing to actually implement automations, MCP servers, scripts, templates.[^3]
- **Layer C: Escalation (Claude/ChatGPT)**  
  Use for long-document reasoning, planning, and “big syntheses,” but still produce structured outputs you can review.[^4]
- **Rule: “Tool per role”** to avoid subscription/workflow sprawl.[^5]

This matches your goal: Jarvis becomes a production system for drafts + automation, while you remain editor-in-chief.

## The implementation plan (practical + incremental)
### Phase 1 (Foundation): Make Jarvis “memoryful” in a controlled way
Create a single **context-aware prompt + workflow contract** for any agent touching the vault. Your own notes already outline a strong pattern: the agent should search notes first, reference with `[[note-title]]`, and append important decisions/summaries to daily notes.[^6]

**What to implement in Jarvis:**
- A standard “agent work format”:
  - Always produce:
    - “What I changed / propose”
    - “Files/notes affected”
    - “Why”
    - “Next review questions for you”
- A daily capture flow:
  - “Conversation summary → Daily note”
  - “Action items → task note/project note”
  - “New concepts → concept notes (sprout status)”

This directly supports your “AI writes, I refine, then I commit” approach.

### Phase 2 (Pipelines): Turn conversations and tool output into structured notes
You want “all conversations with my AI, MCP connectors, extensions, etc.” The scalable way is not to store raw chats everywhere, but to store:
- Raw logs (archive)
- Plus *structured* derived notes (summaries, decisions, learnings)

You already have a hint of this in your planning: build weekly recaps from notes → saved output.[^7]

**Minimum viable pipelines to build:**
- **Conversation ingestion → summary note**
  - Input: chat transcript (manual paste or exported)
  - Output:
    - Key decisions
    - Open questions
    - Links to relevant notes
    - “Promotable knowledge” section (what should be turned into evergreen notes)
- **Weekly recap automation**
  - Input: daily notes for the week
  - Output: weekly review note with themes, wins, failures, next week focus (and links)

### Phase 3 (Connectors/MCP): Give the agent safe “hands”
Your [[MCPs]] note is basically your roadmap: filesystem MCP, git MCP, GitHub MCP, and an “Obsidian second brain manager” that updates notes carefully and tracks changes.[^8]

**How to implement safely:**
- Start with the **Obsidian-aware toolset** you described (search/read/create/append), but restrict behavior:
  - Prefer `append_to_note` over rewriting
  - If rewriting, require “proposed diff” style output and your approval
- Add **Git MCP** early so every change is auditable:
  - Auto-generated commit messages/changelogs
  - “Flag risky diffs” style reviews (even if done manually at first)[^8]

### Phase 4 (RAG over Jarvis): Make it generate *new knowledge* from your vault
Your notes already call out building a RAG system over your notes as a key milestone (“use Obsidian vault as knowledge base → query notes intelligently”).[^9] This is the part that turns Jarvis from storage into an actual “insight engine.”

**Jarvis RAG outcomes you want:**
- Ask: “What am I repeatedly struggling with?” → get patterns from journals + project notes
- Ask: “Summarize everything I learned about MCP routing” → get grounded synthesis with backlinks
- Ask: “What should I study next for AI/ML given my progress?” → uses your own tracker notes and roadmap

If you later productize it, you already sketched a related direction: an AI-powered study assistant with RAG-based Q&A over notes.[^10]

## Guardrails (so the vault doesn’t become AI sludge)
- **Keep AI-written text in Jarvis as drafts** until promoted.
- Use your existing “avoid tool overload” principle and keep roles strict.[^5]
- Require every automation to output:
  - backlinks (`[[...]]`)
  - tasks
  - a short “confidence/uncertainty” block (even if informal)
- Prefer “interlinking + summarizing + extracting actions” over generating lots of prose.

## What I can do next (pick one)
- Write a concrete “Jarvis Operating Manual” note: roles, pipelines, templates, and review workflow (based strictly on the patterns in your notes).  
- Draft the specification for your “Obsidian Second Brain Manager MCP” (inputs/outputs, allowed operations, change tracking), based on your [[MCPs]] description.[^8]  
- Turn your Obsidian-aware prompt (the `obsidian-aware.md` concept) into a finalized standard prompt + checklist you can reuse across Claude/ChatGPT/Ollama.[^6]

# Jarvis Operating Manual (AI-Optimized Vault)

## Purpose
Jarvis is the AI-augmented “lab vault” where drafts, automations, and structured summaries are generated first, then reviewed and refined before being promoted into stable knowledge.

## Core Principles
- **Layered roles, not one giant agent**: assign tools clear jobs (private/local vs coding vs escalation) to prevent tool overload and keep the system reliable.[^1]
- **Tool-per-role**: keep each tool scoped to one role; avoid subscription/workflow sprawl.[^1]
- **Draft-first, reviewable artifacts**: Jarvis should produce structured outputs you can approve (summaries, decisions, links), not uncontrolled rewriting.

---

## Roles (Layered Tooling Model)

### Layer A — Private/Local Brain (Ollama)
**Use for:**
- Private note processing
- Extracting patterns
- Summarizing and preparing prompts (especially when you don’t want data leaving your machine)[^1]

**Typical outputs:**
- Bullet summaries
- Extracted entities/concepts
- Prompt drafts to reuse elsewhere

### Layer B — Coding Hands (Cursor/Copilot)
**Use for:**
- Repo-aware editing
- Implementing automations, MCP servers, scripts, templates.[^1]

**Typical outputs:**
- Scripts to collect notes modified this week
- Automation glue code (triggers → prompt → save note)
- Templates for note types

### Layer C — Escalation / Long-Context Reasoning (Claude/ChatGPT)
**Use for:**
- Long-document reasoning
- Planning multi-step workflows
- Producing “big syntheses,” but still in structured, reviewable formats.[^1]

**Typical outputs:**
- Architecture proposals
- Multi-step plans
- Consolidated “evergreen” drafts ready for your refinement

---

## Pipelines (Minimum Viable)

### Pipeline 1 — Conversation Ingestion → Summary Note
**Goal:** Convert raw AI chat transcripts into structured, linkable knowledge.

**Input:**
- Chat transcript (manual paste or exported)

**Output (must include):**[^2]
- Key decisions
- Open questions
- Links to relevant notes (use `[[note-title]]`)
- “Promotable knowledge” section (what should become evergreen notes)

**Where to store:**
- Raw transcript: archive area (your choice)
- Summary artifact: Jarvis knowledge layer (see “Output Destinations” below)

### Pipeline 2 — Weekly Recap Automation
**Goal:** Systematically synthesize what happened this week into a review note.

**Input:** daily notes / notes modified during the week.[^2]

**Output:** weekly review note containing:[^2]
- Themes
- Wins / failures
- Next-week focus
- Links to relevant notes

**Trigger idea (from your workflow notes):**
- Schedule: Sunday 8 PM
- Collect: all notes modified this week
- Summarize into:
  - Key learnings (3–5 bullets)
  - Projects worked on
  - Concepts mastered
  - Questions/gaps to address next week
- Save into a new weekly recap note with date.[^3]

---

## Templates (Standard Outputs)

### Template A — Conversation Summary Note
Use this format for every imported AI conversation (after raw transcript is stored):

```markdown
---
type: input
input_kind: ai
status: sprout
created: YYYY-MM-DD
tags:
- input
notes:
- "[[Related Note]]"
---

# [Conversation Title] — Summary (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Key decisions
- ...

## Open questions
- ...

## Links to relevant notes
- [[...]]
- [[...]]

## Promotable knowledge (needs refinement)
- Candidate evergreen note: [[...]]
  - Draft claim:
  - Evidence/examples:
  - What to verify/clean up:
```

### Template B — Weekly Recap Note
```markdown
---
type: review
status: sprout
created: YYYY-MM-DD
tags:
- review
notes:
- "[[log]]"
---

# Weekly Recap — YYYY-WW

## Key learnings (3–5)
- ...

## Projects worked on
- ...

## Concepts mastered
- ...

## Questions / gaps for next week
- ...

## Pointers (links)
- [[...]]
- [[...]]
```

### Template C — Reusable “Master Prompt” (Markdown Prompting)
Maintain one strong prompt in markdown and reuse it across assistants.[^4]

```markdown
# Role
...

# Objective
...

# Context
- I take notes in Obsidian
- I want structured, linkable outputs

# Instructions
1. Search before creating
2. Reference notes as [[note-title]]
3. Save decisions + learnings to notes
4. Append conversation summaries to daily notes

# Output Format
## Summary
...
## Decisions
...
## Next actions
...
## Links
- [[...]]
```

(You can base this directly on the “Obsidian tools + workflow rules + memory strategy” prompt skeleton you already outlined.)[^5]

---

## Review Workflow (Human-in-the-loop)

### Step 1 — Capture (raw → structured)
- Store raw transcript in an archive location.
- Run “Conversation Ingestion → Summary Note” to create the structured summary artifact.[^2]

### Step 2 — Refine (reduce AI-written noise)
- Edit the “Promotable knowledge” section:
  - Remove fluff
  - Convert to your own words
  - Add examples and links

### Step 3 — Promote (Jarvis → durable knowledge)
- Turn the best refined chunks into evergreen notes (or update existing ones).
- Ensure backlinks are present (`[[...]]`).

### Step 4 — Recap and track
- Use the weekly recap automation to synthesize learning and plan next steps.[^3]

---

## Vault Operating Contract (Behavior Rules)
Follow the contract you already defined for the assistant operating inside the vault:

- Prefer patching by heading instead of rewriting whole files.
- Preserve frontmatter.
- Search before creating a new note.
- Respect maturity (`status: tree` notes are stable; propose changes first).[^6]

---

## Output Destinations (Recommended)
Use the established Claude layer destinations as the default “AI knowledge layer” structure:

- Session summaries → `60_Claude/10_Session_Logs/log.md`
- Source distillations → `60_Claude/30_Source_Summaries/`
- Evergreen knowledge → `60_Claude/20_Distilled_Notes/`
- Project briefs → `60_Claude/40_Project_Briefs/`
- Daily/weekly reviews → `60_Claude/50_Reviews/`
- Indexes → `60_Claude/60_Indexes/`[^6]

---

## Session End Protocol (Consistency)
At the end of a working session:
- Append what happened to `60_Claude/10_Session_Logs/log.md`
- Record outcomes, open questions, next steps
- Optionally run your “end of day” flow (`/closeday`).[^6]
