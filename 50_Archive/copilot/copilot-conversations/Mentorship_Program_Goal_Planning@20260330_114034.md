**ai**: # Mentorship Program: April Meeting Preparation & Summer Planning Guide

Based on your mentor's background and your goals, here's a structured plan for maximizing the mentorship program through April meetings and summer planning.

---

## April Meeting Framework

### Meeting #1 (Early April): Project Demo & Career Direction

**What to bring:**
- **Portfolio demo** (3 screenshots + live link)[^1]
- **Learning Tracker progress** (even if incomplete)
- **One-pager**: What shipped / What blocked / What deciding next

**Discussion topics:**
- Show current portfolio implementation (chatbot, carousel features)
- Present Learning Tracker MVP scope and technical decisions
- Ask: "Given my timeline (graduation 2027), should I prioritize depth in full-stack or breadth across DevOps/mobile?"
- Request: Code review of one complex component (auth flow or RAG implementation)

**Outcomes to secure:**
- Feedback on architectural decisions (Next.js + Neon + Clerk stack)
- Scope refinement: what to cut before summer
- Introduction to 1-2 Best Buy engineers for informational interviews

---

### Meeting #2 (Mid-April): Summer Strategy & Network Building

**Preparation:**
- Draft summer plan with 3 paths: internship / research project / startup validation
- List 5 companies from [[Companies giving OPT & CPT]] you're targeting[^2]
- Prepare 3 questions about Best Buy's tech stack (React/GraphQL/AWS)

**Discussion framework:**
- "I'm deciding between X, Y, Z for summer. Here's my decision matrix..." (use MoSCoW framework you referenced)
- Practice elevator pitch (30-second version)[^3]
- Ask: "What early career mistakes would you warn against?"

**Action items:**
- Get LinkedIn intro to Best Buy university recruiting team
- Discuss OPT/CPT considerations for international students
- Secure mock interview slot for late April

---

## Summer Planning: Three-Track Strategy

### Track 1: If You Land an Internship (Priority)

**Weeks 1-2: Onboarding + Relationship Building**
- Meet your tech lead and adjacent teams
- Identify one mentor within the company
- Document tech stack in Obsidian (link to what you learned in class)

**Weeks 3-10: Execution + Learning**
- Ship one meaningful feature end-to-end
- Keep "Role Brief" notes (Frontend/Backend/DevOps exposure)[^4]
- Weekly check-ins with Ahnaf: "What I shipped / blockers / decisions"

**Weeks 11-12: Portfolio Conversion**
- Turn internship project into portfolio piece
- Get code review from full-time engineer
- Secure return offer intel or referral for next year

---

### Track 2: If No Internship → Research + Project Sprint

**June: Deep Work on Learning Tracker**
Follow your existing 5-sprint roadmap[^5]:
- Sprint 1: Foundation (auth + DB schema) - Week 1
- Sprint 2: Core MVP (browse + track) - Week 2
- Sprint 3: RAG implementation - Week 3-4
- Sprint 4: Deploy + 3D components - Week 5-6
- Sprint 5: Polish + packaging - Week 7-8

**July: BOOM UROP Extension**
- Apply for UROP symposium in April (you noted this)[^6]
- Continue tracing instrumentation work
- Present at symposium → portfolio artifact
- Turn PR work into technical blog post

**August: Interview Prep + Applications**
- 2 mock interviews with Ahnaf
- Apply to 50+ Fall co-op positions
- Build out portfolio site with 3 projects: Portfolio, Learning Tracker, BOOM observability work

---

### Track 3: Startup Validation (Low-Risk Side Track)

Execute the thought experiments you outlined[^7]:
1. **Problem validation** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Interview 10 students about goal tracking
   - Document pain points in Obsidian
   
2. **MVP wireframes** (Week 3)
   - Figma click-through of CheckIn → progress flow
   - Get feedback from Ahnaf on product thinking

3. **Technical feasibility** (Week 4)
   - Build one core feature (weekly check-in + chart)
   - Don't build teams/notifications yet
   
4. **Validation metric** (Weeks 5-8)
   - Get 5 friends to use it for 2 weeks
   - Track: 10 weekly active users with ≥2 check-ins/week
   - Decision point: pivot, persist, or pause?

**Outcome:** Even if you don't launch, you learn product validation, which Ahnaf's GitHub Copilot POC work suggests he values.

---

## Meeting Cadence for Summer

**Every 2 weeks (6 sessions total):**
- Format: 30-minute Zoom
- Structure: Demo → Shipped/Blocked/Deciding → Ask
- Bring: Updated "Role Brief" each time (cover 6 areas: Frontend, Backend, Full-stack, DevOps, Data, Mobile)

**Sample agenda rotation:**
1. Auth implementation decisions (Week 2)
2. RAG architecture review (Week 4)  
3. Deployment + CI/CD patterns (Week 6)
4. Mock technical interview (Week 8)
5. System design discussion (Week 10)
6. Return offer / recruiting strategy (Week 12)

---

## Networking Strategy (Parallel to Meetings)

**April actions:**
- Request intro to 2 Best Buy engineers (1 frontend, 1 backend)
- Join Best Buy tech talks if they have external events
- Connect with 5 UMN alumni at companies on your target list[^8]

**May-August:**
- 2 informational interviews per month (use template from [[LinkedIn Premium]])[^9]
- Track in Obsidian: company, contact, insights, follow-up
- Build "warm intro" pipeline for Fall recruiting

---

## Decision Framework: What to Prioritize

Use this hierarchy when time-boxing summer work:

**Must-haves:**
1. One shipped project (internship or Learning Tracker deployed)
2. Portfolio live with 3 projects
3. Resume updated with quantified impact
4. 2 technical mock interviews completed

**Should-haves:**
5. Blog post about BOOM observability work
6. 10 informational interviews logged
7. GitHub contribution graph showing consistent commits

**Could-haves:**
8. Startup validation complete
9. Open source contribution
10. Technical talk at UMN CS club

**Won't-haves (defer to Fall):**
- Multi-platform mobile app
- Monetization features
- Complex notification systems

---

## Metrics to Track

Create a simple spreadsheet (link in Obsidian):

| Week | Code commits | Applications sent | Network contacts | Learning hours | Ahnaf meetings |
|------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| June 1 | 25 | 5 | 2 | 15 | 1 |

Review weekly. Adjust if any column is zero for 2 weeks straight.

---

## April Prep Checklist

**By April 5:**
- [ ] Portfolio deployed (even if beta)
- [ ] Learning Tracker repo public with README
- [ ] Summer plan one-pager drafted
- [ ] 3 questions for Ahnaf prepared
- [ ] Elevator pitch practiced (record yourself)

**By April 15:**
- [ ] Mock interview scheduled
- [ ] 5 target companies researched
- [ ] LinkedIn connections sent to Best Buy engineers
- [ ] UROP symposium application submitted[^10]

**By April 30:**
- [ ] Summer decision made (internship / project sprint / hybrid)
- [ ] Next 3 months calendared with milestones
- [ ] GitHub project board set up for summer work
- [ ] Emergency fund / housing / logistics secured

---

## Key Questions to Ask Ahnaf

Rotate these across April meetings:

**Technical:**
- "How do you balance feature velocity vs. technical debt at scale?"
- "What patterns have you seen break when traffic increases 10×?"
- "How do you structure code reviews for junior engineers?"

**Career:**
- "What signals in a resume/portfolio get you to interview someone?"
- "How should international students approach OPT timeline planning?"
- "What's the difference between intern work and new grad expectations?"

**Networking:**
- "Can you intro me to someone in [team X] at Best Buy?"
- "How do you evaluate startup vs. big tech early career?"
- "What questions should I ask in informational interviews?"

---

## Success Metrics for Mentorship Program

By August 31, you should have:
- [ ] 6 meaningful meetings with actionable takeaways
- [ ] 2+ referrals or intros from mentor's network
- [ ] 1 code review or technical deep-dive session
- [ ] Portfolio artifact directly influenced by mentor feedback
- [ ] Clear Fall recruiting strategy with warm leads

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

**Don't:**
- Ask Ahnaf to get you a job (he's explicitly not expected to)[^11]
- Show up unprepared or cancel meetings last-minute
- Only contact when you need something
- Ignore his advice repeatedly without explaining why

**Do:**
- Send thank-you notes after each meeting
- Share wins (deployed feature, good grade, accepted PR)
- Act on his suggestions and report back
- Respect his time (30-min max, clear agenda)

---

## Final Recommendation

**For April:** Focus on **demonstrating execution capability**. Show him you can ship, even if imperfect. That builds trust for deeper technical mentorship.

**For Summer:** Optimize for **learning velocity over perfection**. Ship the Learning Tracker even if it's not production-grade. The process of building, deploying, and iterating with user feedback will teach you more than polishing one feature for weeks.

**For Fall:** Use summer artifacts to **convert mentorship into job opportunities**. Your portfolio should tell the story: "I built X, learned Y from my mentor, and here's how I'd apply it at your company."

The mentorship program is a **relationship-building vehicle, not a transactional exchange**. Treat Ahnaf as a long-term connection who can advise you through multiple career transitions, not just one summer.

## Backup & Fallback Strategy

### When Primary Tool Fails:

**If ChatGPT is down:**
→ Switch to Claude for general tasks  
→ Use Ollama for private work

**If Claude is down:**
→ Use ChatGPT for writing  
→ Break long docs into chunks

**If Cursor fails:**
→ Fall back to VS Code + Copilot  
→ Use ChatGPT web for complex debugging

**If internet is out:**
→ Ollama for offline AI access  
→ Pre-downloaded models for coding help

## Final Recommendations

1. **Don't overthink the tools** - Start with what you have and upgrade only when you hit clear limitations.

2. **Focus on one workflow at a time** - Master prompting before automations, automations before vibe coding.

3. **Build in public** - Share your learning journey. It compounds over time.

4. **Prioritize shipping over perfection** - A deployed imperfect project beats a perfect unfinished one.

5. **Use AI to learn AI** - Let ChatGPT explain ML concepts, Claude review your code, Perplexity find research papers.

6. **Track everything in Obsidian** - Your vault should be the source of truth for all workflows, prompts, and progress.

7. **Exhaust free tools first** - GitHub Copilot + Cursor Student are incredibly powerful. Master them before adding subscriptions.

8. **Connect workflows to real goals** - Every automation should save time for actual learning or building.

The goal isn't to use every AI tool - it's to build a sustainable workflow that accelerates your path to becoming an AI/ML engineer while maintaining high output quality and learning velocity.

Start with the "Immediate" action items today, and iterate based on what works for your specific needs.
