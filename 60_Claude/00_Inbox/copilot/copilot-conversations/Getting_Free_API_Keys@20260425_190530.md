**user**: I want to get free api keys, how do i do it?

**ai**: From the context you provided, there isn’t a single universal way to “get free API keys.” The document is a curated list of public APIs, and it shows (per API) whether authentication is required (“Auth” column: `apiKey`, `OAuth`, or “No”)—meaning some APIs require you to obtain an API key from that provider, while others don’t require any auth at all. [^1]

What you can do based on this list:

- Pick an API that says **Auth = No** (no key needed). For example, in the Security section: **Classify**, **Dehash.lt**, **EmailRep**, etc. show “No” under Auth. [^1]
- If you want something that does require a key, choose a provider and follow their documentation/signup flow. The list links to each API’s docs (e.g., “HaveIBeenPwned” shows `apiKey` and links to its API page). [^1]
- For some products in the list (e.g., APILayer items like Screenshotlayer/Mailboxlayer), the table points you to documentation pages, which is where you’d typically find how to obtain a key. [^2]

If you tell me which category/API you want (e.g., “Music: Spotify” or “Security: HaveIBeenPwned”), I can point to the exact entry in this context and confirm whether it needs a key (`apiKey`/`OAuth`) or not.

**user**: I want to modify this searching method in github to find anthropic api keys: "(path:*.xml OR path:*.json OR path:*.properties OR path:*.sql OR path:*.txt OR path:*.log OR path:*.tmp OR path:*.backup OR path:*.bak OR path:*.enc OR path:*.yml OR path:*.yaml OR path:*.toml OR path:*.ini OR path:*.config OR path:*.conf OR path:*.cfg OR path:*.env OR path:*.envrc OR path:*.prod OR path:*.secret OR path:*.private OR path:*.key) AND (access_key OR secret_key OR access_token OR api_key OR apikey OR api_secret OR apiSecret OR app_secret OR application_key OR app_key OR appkey OR auth_token OR authsecret) AND ("sk-" AND (openai OR gpt))"

**ai**: I can’t help modify GitHub search queries to find **Anthropic API keys** (or any provider’s real secrets) because that’s instructions for locating exposed credentials.

What I *can* do is point to options in your notes for getting “free” access without hunting leaked keys:

- Use APIs that require **no authentication** (Auth = “No”) from the public API list. Your note explicitly suggests: “Pick an API that says **Auth = No (no key needed)**.” [^1]
- If an API requires `apiKey` or `OAuth`, the approach in your note is to “choose a provider and follow their documentation/signup flow” to obtain a legitimate key. [^1]
- Your [[10_Areas/UMN/Links]] note includes resources like **“Free LLM API Sources”** and **OpenRouter** as a place to access free LLM models (i.e., alternatives to needing a specific provider key). [^2]

If you tell me what you’re trying to build (e.g., “I need a chat model API with a free tier”), I can help you pick an option from the links you’ve saved and outline a legit setup path.
