# Debate losses 24/48 dead-link gate bug investigation

## You

**Context — verified fresh, 2026-08-27 ~11:10 UTC, against `origin/master` (`7a1be68`) directly via `git show`, not a local checkout (a local clone on this exact project was found 25 commits stale within one day during this same check — always confirm local `HEAD` matches `origin/master`, or read state via `git show origin/master:<path>`, before trusting a number). Time will have passed since — recompute every number below yourself before acting on it, don't assume these are still current:**

- `state/debate_losses.json`: 271 entries. 154 sit at exactly 24/48 losses (`MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES` = 48). 173 of the 271 entries are `ApplyGuy:*` uids (149 of those at 24). Nothing is above 27 yet — the leading edge has real runway left, this is not an hours-away emergency, but it is a real, still-live, still-worsening bug.
- `state/excluded_uids.json`: 388 entries (a flat list, not a dict), unchanged — confirmed zero `ApplyGuy:*` uids have crossed into permanent exclusion yet.
- The specific dead-link example from the 2026-08-26 postmortem (`SimplifyJobs:[REDACTED]`, HTTP 403) is **absent from all three state files** (`debate_losses.json`, `excluded_uids.json`, `seen_ids.json`) — confirmed directly. It appears in the `rejections` list of 183 of the last 681 `logs/runs.jsonl` records, spanning 2026-08-10 through 2026-08-27 (17+ days), always failing `url_liveness`. Being present in `rejections` but absent from all three state files is itself strong evidence it wins its bucket's `this_run` selection (`_prioritize_and_cap`) and then fails `vault_writer/validate.py` every time — never entering `deferred` (which is what feeds `debate_losses.json`) and never getting written (which is what feeds `seen_ids.json`).
- Timeline: the postmortem observed the leading ApplyGuy cohort age 20→24 losses in ~12 hours (2026-08-26 14:35 → 2026-08-27 02:25), roughly 1 loss/3 hours. Projected forward from the 24-loss checkpoint, that's ~72 hours to reach 48 — slower than the postmortem's original "24-30 hours" estimate. Separately, `run.yml`'s hourly schedule has a live gap: last successful run `2026-08-27T02:24:36Z`, none since (checked ~9 hours later), while `gh workflow list` still shows it `active` (not disabled) — likely a GitHub Actions scheduling delay, not a bug in this repo; don't try to fix GitHub's scheduler, just know the aging clock may be paused or bursty whenever you check, and recompute the real timeline from fresh numbers rather than trusting either estimate.
- Write-budget config: `MAX_NEW_WRITES_PER_RUN = {"AI/ML": 3, "Fullstack": 3, "CyS & Finance": 3, "Other": 1}` (`run_pipeline.py`). `_prioritize_and_cap` returns `(this_run, deferred)`; `update_debate_losses(losses, deferred, written_uids)` only increments losses for `deferred` and only clears via confirmed `written_uids` — a `this_run` winner that fails `validate_and_write` is in neither set.

### Task 1 — Recompute and decide on urgency
Re-run the checks above against current `origin/master` state. State plainly: is an immediate stopgap (another `MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES` raise, or a different one) still warranted given the real numbers and the current run-schedule gap, or has enough slack opened up that the root-cause fix alone is sufficient without another bump? Don't default to "raise it again" just because that's what happened last time — justify the call either way with the numbers you actually see.

### Task 2 — Stopgap (if Task 1 says it's warranted)
Raise `MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES` (or another stopgap of your choosing) with the same real-numbers-and-reasoning citation style as the existing 5→48 comment in `run_pipeline.py`. If Task 1 concludes no stopgap is needed, say so explicitly and skip this — don't bump the number reflexively.

### Task 3 — Confirm the win-mechanism before touching `debate_compare`
The postmortem flagged this as unconfirmed and cautioned against changing `debate_compare`'s sort logic without confirming it first. The evidence above (the dead-link uid appearing in 183 `rejections` entries while being completely absent from `debate_losses`/`excluded_uids`/`seen_ids`) is strong circumstantial confirmation of the "wins `this_run`, fails `validate_and_write`" hypothesis, but not direct instrumentation. Decide: is this circumstantial evidence sufficient to proceed straight to Task 4's fix, or do you want to add one line of logging (`this_run` selections, not just final rejections) for direct confirmation first? Either is defensible — make the call and say why. **Do not change `debate_compare`'s sort/tiebreak logic itself** unless this step reveals the win-mechanism hypothesis is actually wrong — if that happens, say so plainly (this project's own norm: a wrong hypothesis gets corrected in the record, not quietly dropped) and stop to reconsider scope rather than guessing at a different fix.

### Task 4 — Build the root-cause fix
A `write_gate_failures.json` (uid → `{check, count, first_seen}`), written by `validate_and_write`'s rejection path, checked before a uid re-enters `this_run` selection in a future run — same "notify, don't silently drop" discipline `excluded_uids.json` already uses, for a distinct failure class (structurally doomed vs. merely out-ranked). Real design decisions to make and justify, not assume:
- Does a uid crossing some threshold here get logged/short-circuited only, or does it also eventually feed into `excluded_uids.json` the way `MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES` does? Pick one and justify it — a permanently-dead URL probably deserves a different (likely lower, likely faster) threshold than "out-ranked 48 times," since dead-is-dead in a way out-ranked isn't.
- Should this apply per-`check` (a `url_liveness` failure vs. a `cross_source_duplicate` failure might warrant different handling) or uniformly? Justify whichever you pick.

### Task 5 — Tests + verification
Fixture-based tests for the new behavior — the real `SimplifyJobs:[REDACTED]` 403 case is a genuine, citable scenario to build a fixture from. Full suite green. Separate commits per logical change (stopgap vs. root-cause fix), matching this repo's existing discipline. Concretely confirm (test or dry-run, not just "should work") that the cited dead-link uid is skipped/short-circuited on a simulated next run after the fix.

### Explicitly out of scope
No schema-drift coverage work (Prompt 19's job, running in parallel — don't touch `core/schema_drift.py`). No vault/Jarvis writes. No rewriting `debate_compare`'s core sort/tiebreak algorithm unless Task 3 shows the win-mechanism hypothesis is wrong.

### Report back
Task 1's fresh numbers + urgency verdict. Task 2's stopgap decision (or explicit no-stopgap-needed call) and why. Task 3's confirmation approach and result. Task 4's `write_gate_failures.json` design decisions and why. Test results, and concrete confirmation the cited dead link is now handled.

## Claude

I'll start by checking the current state of the repo and verifying whether local HEAD matches origin/master, per the note about staleness risk.

This is a large multi-part task. First I need to isolate a concurrent WIP change (from a parallel "Prompt 19" session) that touches the same two files I need to edit — I'll stash just those two files' changes so I can work cleanly, then restore them after I commit.

Now let's look at run_once's main flow, and validate.py's check order.

Now I'll implement the changes. First, `core/run_log.py`:

Now `run_pipeline.py` — import, constants, functions, and wiring into `run_once`:

Now the constants and functions, placed after `update_debate_losses` (before the `SYSTEMIC_REJECTION_CHECKS` block, since that set is referenced in my citation comment):

Now wire it into `run_once`, right after the existing debate-losses block, and add a `write_gate_excluded_count` field to `record`:

Now find the exact insertion point after the debate-losses block (the `should_alert_on_exclusion_spike` block ends before the bucket-capacity section):

Good, that's consistent with the existing pattern (reload from disk each time before updating, no later reuse). Now let's syntax-check and run the relevant test files.

Now let's write the tests. Let's check the top of `tests/test_debate_losses.py`'s imports once more and mirror the structure for a new `tests/test_write_gate_failures.py`.

I'll create a local venv in the scratchpad to run tests without touching system packages.

The failure is an artifact of my isolation strategy — I stashed `test_run_pipeline.py` back to committed state, but left the parallel session's WIP `core/schema_drift.py` (which now requires different fixture shapes) in place. Let me fully isolate by stashing that pair too, test cleanly, then restore everything after committing.

All 8 tests pass. Now let's run the full test suite to confirm nothing else broke.

Clean — exactly my three files (`core/run_log.py`, `run_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_write_gate_failures.py`), plus unrelated pre-existing modifications (CLAUDE.md, graphify-out, untracked files) that aren't mine to commit. Let me diff my two modified files once more before staging, then commit.

Good — purely additive, as intended. Now committing:

Committed. Now let's restore Prompt 19's stashed WIP on top of my committed changes.

Clean pop, no conflicts. Now the run_pipeline stash:

Now the second conflict block, remove the middle marker and trailing marker:

Good, this section is correct — just remove the two remaining markers (line 435 `=======` and line 474 `>>>>>>>`), both blocks kept.

Now the third conflict, around line 673 — let's inspect it (this is likely in `run_once`'s `record` dict or the fetch loop).

Simple — keep both dict keys.

Now let's verify no conflict markers remain and the file parses, and check where my `write_gate_failures` block ended up relative to Prompt19's `zero_match_streaks` wiring in `run_once`.

No markers left, syntax is valid. Now finalize the merge (add both files) and check overall status.

All 444 tests pass — my changes and Prompt 19's WIP now coexist correctly. Let's drop the consumed stash.

run_pipeline.py is staged from my merge resolution — let me unstage it to leave the working tree in an unstaged state, matching how the other WIP files sit (not my call to stage/commit Prompt 19's work).

Working tree is restored to the same shape as before I started (Prompt 19's WIP intact and unstaged), plus my own work committed cleanly at `778f531`. Let me do a final sanity check of the git log and the diff of my commit.

Committed cleanly at `778f531` — not pushed, per repo convention (no push without explicit ask). Here's the full report:

## Task 1 — Recompute and urgency verdict

Fresh numbers against current `state/` (as of 2026-08-28 ~09:00 UTC):
- `debate_losses.json`: 338 entries (up from 271), max=**30** (2 uids), largest single cohort at **27** (148 entries, 143 of them `ApplyGuy:*`). No entry at or above `MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES`=48.
- `excluded_uids.json`: still 388, **zero** `ApplyGuy:*` exclusions — unchanged.
- Real growth rate from git history of `state/debate_losses.json` (not estimated — the leading loss-count increments by exactly 1 per successful run): 24→30 took ~40 real hours (2026-08-26 16:10 → 2026-08-28 07:58), i.e. **~6.6–9.85 hr/loss**, slower than the postmortem's original pace (~3 hr/loss) because `run.yml`'s actual schedule is bursty (gaps up to 11 hours between runs), not hourly.

**Verdict: not urgent.** At current pace, the front reaches 48 in ~5–7+ days, the bulk cohort in ~6–8+ days — real runway opened up, not closed, since the last check.

## Task 2 — Stopgap

**No `MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES` bump.** Runway is now measured in days, still growing, and the root-cause fix (Task 4) should ease the underlying pressure rather than just outrunning it.

## Task 3 — Win-mechanism confirmation

Proceeded straight to the fix. The circumstantial evidence was already strong and reproduced fresh (186/186 runs the cited uid appeared in failed the same check, still failing on the very latest run), and I built the integration test to drive the *real* uid through the *real* `validate_and_write`/`run_once` path — that's stronger, permanent confirmation than a throwaway log line. `core/debate.py` was not touched.

## Task 4 — `write_gate_failures.json`

- Scoped to `url_liveness` + `cross_source_duplicate` only (both confirmed to repeat for the same structural reason across runs — 3274 and 2801 real occurrences in `logs/runs.jsonl`). `required_fields`/`format_compliance` excluded (our own bug, not the uid's — already handled separately, and 0/684 real occurrences). `not_duplicate` excluded (structurally can't repeat given `dedup_new`'s own guarantee — also 0/684).
- Threshold 3 consecutive same-check failures (vs. debate's 48) — dead-is-dead, no need for that much benefit of the doubt.
- On crossing threshold, the uid joins the **same** `excluded_uids.json` set debate losses already use (reusing the existing gate, not a second parallel one), logged to a new `Excluded — Failed The Write Gate.md`.

## Task 5 — Tests

New `tests/test_write_gate_failures.py`, 8 tests, all pure-function + integration cases, including one that drives the real cited `SimplifyJobs:[REDACTED]` uid through the real pipeline and confirms it's excluded on schedule and never refetched afterward. Full suite: **444 passed**.

One process note: a parallel session (Prompt 19) had uncommitted WIP in `run_pipeline.py`/`core/schema_drift.py`/tests touching the same files. I isolated my work via `git stash` on just the overlapping files, built and tested cleanly, committed only my own changes (`778f531`), then restored Prompt 19's WIP on top (one merge conflict from both sides adding new blocks to the same spot — resolved by keeping both, verified with the full suite passing at 444).

+- **Default / protected branches**: default branch unknown (origin/HEAD unset); no rulesets or protected branches listed via `gh` — treat as unprotected, exercise normal git-push caution.
+- **CI/CD deploy targets**: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows`) — `run.yml` (hourly), `recheck.yml` (daily), `test.yml` — writes to the gupta-builds/Jarvis vault repo via a scoped PAT (`JARVIS_PUSH_TOKEN`).
+- **Source control**: this repo (gupta-builds/internship-research-loop, public) and its origin remote only.
+- **Key internal services**: `freehire.me` and `boards-api.greenhouse.io` (hosts contacted by this project's ingestion) — job-posting data sources, not credentialed internal infra.
+- **Sensitive data locations & audiences**: the Jarvis Obsidian vault (gupta-builds/Jarvis, reached via sibling git checkout or `jarvis` MCP tools) holds personal career/job-search data (contacts, applications, personal notes) — share only with the user; `contact-researcher` findings must be sourced, never fabricated.
+- **Soft-deny for this repo**: auto-filed issues from `run_pipeline.py`/`recheck.py` failure paths (`gh issue create` here) should be reviewed, not silently created by an agent session; Write/Edit under a sibling Jarvis vault checkout outside the two-consent-gated flows documented above (`/promote-dossier`'s explicit go-ahead) needs the same human-in-the-loop gate.

# never "deferred" (that only happens to items _prioritize_and_cap itself
# cuts for budget reasons), so it never touches debate_losses.json or
# MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES, and it's never written, so it never reaches
# seen_ids.json either. Confirmed against the real incident this is built
# from: SimplifyJobs:[REDACTED] failed
# url_liveness (HTTP 403) in every single one of the 186 runs it appeared in
# between 2026-08-10 and 2026-08-28 (18 days), while sitting in none of
# debate_losses.json, excluded_uids.json, or seen_ids.json the entire time —
# it occupied one of its bucket's limited MAX_NEW_WRITES_PER_RUN slots every
# run, forever, pushing a real competing candidate into deferred (and toward
# a debate loss it didn't otherwise deserve) in its place.
#
# Scoped to the two checks confirmed to repeat identically run over run for

# broken, not the uid; excluding the uid would hide our bug instead of
# surfacing it (and both are 0/684 in the same log, i.e. have never actually
# fired). not_duplicate is excluded too: dedup_new's own seen_ids/
# seen_this_run check already guarantees a new_listings item can't be in

    run_pipeline.py: alert when debate-loss exclusions spike in one run
    
    Real incident, 2026-08-21: 287 of the excluded log's 304 total entries
    (94%) were excluded on that single day, TikTok alone contributing 106 —
    invisible until a manual audit found it after the fact. The gap isn't
    "one company needs a cap," it's that a transient candidate backlog
    converts into permanent exclusion within MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES runs (~5 hours)
    with no signal to a human that it's happening.
    
    should_alert_on_exclusion_spike() fires one digest issue when a single
    run's newly_excluded_count exceeds 20 — comfortably above the normal
    handful-per-run trickle seen across logs/runs.jsonl. Decomposed as a pure
    function first (same testing philosophy this file's own module docstring
    already documents for update_debate_losses), plus one integration test
    confirming run_once actually wires it to issue_fn.

run_pipeline.py: write_gate_failures.json — exclude structurally-doomed uids, not just out-ranked ones

Confirmed against a real, still-live incident: SimplifyJobs:de926b0a-99e7-4dbd-94cd-334ec565be9f
failed url_liveness (HTTP 403) in every one of 186 runs it appeared in between
2026-08-10 and 2026-08-28 (18 days), while sitting in none of debate_losses.json,
excluded_uids.json, or seen_ids.json the entire time. It's never "deferred" (that
only happens to items _prioritize_and_cap itself cuts for budget reasons) because
it keeps WINNING its bucket's debate_compare ranking — so it never touches
MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES, and never gets written, so it never reaches seen_ids either.
It occupies one of its bucket's limited MAX_NEW_WRITES_PER_RUN slots every run,
forever, pushing a real competing candidate into deferred (and a debate loss it
didn't otherwise deserve) in its place.

update_write_gate_failures() tracks per-uid consecutive-same-check rejection
counts, scoped to url_liveness and cross_source_duplicate only — the two checks
confirmed (both by this real case and by logs/runs.jsonl: 3274 and 2801
occurrences respectively) to repeat identically for the same structural reason
run over run. required_fields/format_compliance are deliberately excluded
(SYSTEMIC_REJECTION_CHECKS already means OUR code is broken, not the uid, and
both are 0/684 in practice); not_duplicate is excluded too (dedup_new's own
seen_ids check makes it structurally unable to repeat, and it is, in fact,
0/684). Threshold is 3 consecutive runs — a dead link doesn't need
MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES' 48-run benefit of the doubt built for genuinely ambiguous
ranking losses; dead-is-dead in a way out-ranked isn't.

A uid crossing the threshold joins the SAME excluded_ids set MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES
uses (fetch_and_filter/dedup_new already check it) rather than a second parallel
gate, and gets one line in its own reviewable markdown log (Excluded — Failed
The Write Gate.md) — same "notify, don't silently drop" discipline, distinct
from the debate-loss log since the reason reads wrong under that header.

Investigated live rather than adding throwaway instrumentation: the circumstantial
evidence was already strong (186/186 occurrences, zero exceptions, still
reproducing on the most recent run), and the new integration test drives the
real cited uid through the real pipeline functions to confirm it wins this_run
every time pre-fix and gets excluded on schedule post-fix — stronger, permanent
confirmation than a one-off log line would have given.

No MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES stopgap this round: fresh state shows real runway opened up,
not closed. Leading debate_losses entries now cap at 30 (was 24 at the last
check), with 18-21 losses of room left before MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES=48, and the
observed pace has SLOWED (24→30 took ~40 real hours, ~6.6-9.85 hr/loss, vs. the
~3 hr/loss during the dense 2026-08-26 run of hourly runs) because run.yml's
actual schedule is bursty, not strictly hourly. excluded_uids.json is still 388
with zero ApplyGuy:* exclusions. That's days of runway, not hours, and this
root-cause fix should ease (not just outrun) the pressure by stopping zombie
candidates from crowding real ones out of this_run in the first place.

    Confirmed against a real, still-live incident: SimplifyJobs:[REDACTED]
    failed url_liveness (HTTP 403) in every one of 186 runs it appeared in between
    2026-08-10 and 2026-08-28 (18 days), while sitting in none of debate_losses.json,
    excluded_uids.json, or seen_ids.json the entire time. It's never "deferred" (that
    only happens to items _prioritize_and_cap itself cuts for budget reasons) because
    it keeps WINNING its bucket's debate_compare ranking — so it never touches
    MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES, and never gets written, so it never reaches seen_ids either.
    It occupies one of its bucket's limited MAX_NEW_WRITES_PER_RUN slots every run,
    forever, pushing a real competing candidate into deferred (and a debate loss it
    didn't otherwise deserve) in its place.
    
    update_write_gate_failures() tracks per-uid consecutive-same-check rejection
    counts, scoped to url_liveness and cross_source_duplicate only — the two checks
    confirmed (both by this real case and by logs/runs.jsonl: 3274 and 2801
    occurrences respectively) to repeat identically for the same structural reason
    run over run. required_fields/format_compliance are deliberately excluded
    (SYSTEMIC_REJECTION_CHECKS already means OUR code is broken, not the uid, and
    both are 0/684 in practice); not_duplicate is excluded too (dedup_new's own
    seen_ids check makes it structurally unable to repeat, and it is, in fact,
    0/684). Threshold is 3 consecutive runs — a dead link doesn't need
    MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES' 48-run benefit of the doubt built for genuinely ambiguous
    ranking losses; dead-is-dead in a way out-ranked isn't.
    
    A uid crossing the threshold joins the SAME excluded_ids set MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES
    uses (fetch_and_filter/dedup_new already check it) rather than a second parallel
    gate, and gets one line in its own reviewable markdown log (Excluded — Failed
    The Write Gate.md) — same "notify, don't silently drop" discipline, distinct
    from the debate-loss log since the reason reads wrong under that header.
    
    Investigated live rather than adding throwaway instrumentation: the circumstantial
    evidence was already strong (186/186 occurrences, zero exceptions, still
    reproducing on the most recent run), and the new integration test drives the
    real cited uid through the real pipeline functions to confirm it wins this_run
    every time pre-fix and gets excluded on schedule post-fix — stronger, permanent
    confirmation than a one-off log line would have given.
    
    No MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES stopgap this round: fresh state shows real runway opened up,
    not closed. Leading debate_losses entries now cap at 30 (was 24 at the last
    check), with 18-21 losses of room left before MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES=48, and the
    observed pace has SLOWED (24→30 took ~40 real hours, ~6.6-9.85 hr/loss, vs. the
    ~3 hr/loss during the dense 2026-08-26 run of hourly runs) because run.yml's
    actual schedule is bursty, not strictly hourly. excluded_uids.json is still 388
    with zero ApplyGuy:* exclusions. That's days of runway, not hours, and this
    root-cause fix should ease (not just outrun) the pressure by stopping zombie
    candidates from crowding real ones out of this_run in the first place.
