# Intern applications round 2

## You

**The other half of the same real, deadline-ordered list** (round-robin split with Prompt 26 so both sessions cover the full urgency range, not front-loaded/back-loaded):

1. `List/Dossiers/2 - Fullstack/Data Engineering Intern - Castleton Commodities International.md` — deadline 2026-09-01
2. `List/Dossiers/1 - AI & ML/Analytics and Quantitative Modeling Intern - Analytics & Quantitative Modeling - KeyBank.md` — deadline 2026-09-04
3. `List/Dossiers/1 - AI & ML/Machine Learning Intern - OpRegen Machine Learning - Genentech.md` — deadline 2026-09-08
4. `List/Dossiers/1 - AI & ML/Software Engineer Intern - LPL Financial Holdings.md` — priority deadline 2026-09-21
5. `List/Dossiers/Other/Technology, Operations, Digital, and Data Analytics Intern - Regions Bank.md` — deadline 2026-09-25
6. `List/Dossiers/3 - CyS & Finance/Infrastructure Engineer Intern [2027 Intern Program] - DTCC.md` — deadline 2026-10-01
7. `List/Dossiers/Other/Application Engineer Co-opIntern - PCS - GE Vernova.md` — deadline 2026-10-02

**Efficiency note, real: two of these (#1 here, plus #3 in Prompt 26's list) share Castleton Commodities International, and #4 here shares LPL Financial with #4 in Prompt 26's list.** These are running in two different sessions, so you can't literally reuse the other session's research — but check whether either company's contact/program info is already sitting in a `Considering/`/`Serious/` note or a Contact note from prior work before re-researching from zero.

Same scope boundary, same discipline, same report-back shape as Prompt 26 — see that prompt's text for the full detail, it applies identically here.

## Claude

I'll check the vault for existing notes on the two shared companies (Castleton Commodities International, LPL Financial) before dispatching research, then research all 7 companies.

Castleton already has two promoted programs with existing Contact notes; LPL Financial has none yet. Let me pull the existing Castleton contact info to reuse rather than re-research.

Confirmed: only Castleton has existing contact research (reusable). KeyBank, Genentech, LPL Financial, Regions Bank, DTCC, and GE Vernova all need fresh research. Launching contact-researcher agents in parallel for those six.

Six contact-researcher agents are running in the background for KeyBank, Genentech, LPL Financial, Regions Bank, DTCC, and GE Vernova. Castleton Commodities International (#1 in this list) already has real, sourced contact research in the vault from a prior promotion (Lauren Haymond, Alissa Turpin) — reused rather than re-run. I'll report back with each company's findings as the agents complete.

<result>This confirms the program is real and live on KeyBank's own careers domain (`key.com/about/careers/students-and-graduates/interns/quant-risk-management-intern.html`, titled "Quantitative Modeling and Analytics Internship Program," and listed under Strategy &amp; Analytics on the intern-programs index page). Now I have everything needed to write the report.

## Contact research: KeyBank

### Recruiter / university recruiting search
- "Jordan M. — Senior Recruiter" — https://www.key.com/about/careers/find-your-career-path/employee-spotlight/jordan.html (query: "KeyBank recruiter") — KeyBank's own employee-spotlight page, first name + last initial only as published (no fuller name given by the source; not filled in)
- "Tanya Henderson - Senior Recruiter for KeyBank" — https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanya-henderson-0210505 (query: "KeyBank recruiter", general web search — title/description snippet only, not scraped)

### Engineering blog byline
- nothing found — `fc_search("KeyBank engineering blog")` returned KeyBank's Software Engineering careers-path page, an AWS Marketplace case-study post, a Banking Dive article, a Google Cloud customer case study, and a third-party Medium post about KeyBank's "Tech Ready" program — none is a KeyBank-run eng blog with an authored byline

### GitHub org
- org: github.com/orgs/cn-keybank/people — best GitHub-search match for "KeyBank type:org", but no public members (`public_members` returned empty) and no description/blog/company metadata tying it to KeyBank the bank (created 2019, 9 public repos, 0 followers-worth of signal). Not confident this is actually KeyBank's org rather than a same-name unrelated org — treating as **no matching public org found** rather than reporting it as a real hit.

### LinkedIn search-snippet
- The dedicated `linkedin_recruiter_snippet(company, key)` call (query `site:linkedin.com KeyBank recruiter`) hit Firecrawl 429 rate-limiting on 4 attempts across ~20s of retries and never returned data — genuinely could not complete this specific query.
- Substitute evidence: the general `fc_search("KeyBank recruiter")` call (which uses the same non-scraping snippet mechanism) surfaced one linkedin.com hit: "Tanya Henderson - Senior Recruiter for KeyBank" — https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanya-henderson-0210505 — title/description snippet only, URL never fetched.

### Notes
- linkedin_recruiter_snippet() itself was rate-limited (429) every attempt and never returned a result — its absence above is a tool failure, not a "nothing found." The Tanya Henderson hit came from the equivalent general recruiter-search query, using the same search-snippet-only mechanism (no scrape), so it's reported as the LinkedIn finding for this category.
- cn-keybank GitHub org skipped as unverified match, not reported as a real contact source (see above) — avoiding a false positive per the "wrong guess is worse than empty" rule.
- Program legitimacy: confirmed live and real on KeyBank's own domain — `https://www.key.com/about/careers/students-and-graduates/interns/quant-risk-management-intern.html` ("Quantitative Modeling and Analytics Internship Program") is linked directly from KeyBank's own intern-programs index (`https://www.key.com/about/careers/students-and-graduates/intern-programs.html`) under "Strategy &amp; Analytics," and a 2027-cycle LinkedIn job posting for "Analytics and Quantitative Modeling Internship — Cleveland at KeyBank" corroborates the role name/location — matches the dossier's role title closely (dossier says "Analytics &amp; Quantitative Modeling").
- No login-walled or CAPTCHA-gated pages were encountered or attempted; the LinkedIn profile URLs above were never scraped, only their search-result title/description text was read.</result>

KeyBank research is in — noting it and waiting for the other five before reporting.

KeyBank done (recruiter leads: Jordan M. and Tanya Henderson via LinkedIn snippets; program confirmed live on key.com). Waiting on Genentech, LPL Financial, Regions Bank, DTCC, and GE Vernova.

I have everything needed. Final report:

## Contact research: GE Vernova

### Recruiter / university recruiting search
- Marie Jones — Recruiter and Talent Sourcing Guru at GE Vernova — https://www.linkedin.com/in/marie-jones-b8089258 (query: "GE Vernova recruiter")
- Toni Fiore — Sr. Recruiter, DZ Connex for GE Vernova Renewable Energy — https://www.eskill.com/resources/webinar/on-demand-webinar-how-ge-vernova-improved-candidate-experience-and-recruiting-efficiency (query: "GE Vernova recruiter")
- Kellie Nickovich — University Recruiter, NAM (North America), GE Vernova — https://www.linkedin.com/posts/[REDACTED] (query: "GE Vernova university recruiting", also surfaced by "GE Vernova recruiter")
- careers.gevernova.com/early-careers — GE Vernova's own early-careers hub (not a named contact, but relevant landing page) (query: "GE Vernova university recruiting")

### Engineering blog byline
- nothing found — GE Vernova's software blog (gevernova.com/software/blog) and news hub (The Current) turned up in the "engineering blog" search, but no post with an author byline was surfaced (bylines are stripped/summary-only in the search result descriptions; no scrape performed since this contact-research task only permits search results, not scraping, per this agent's scope).

### GitHub org
- org: https://github.com/orgs/ge-grid-software (confirmed via GitHub API: name = "GE Vernova Grid Software", description references the GridOS ecosystem — a genuine GE Vernova org)
  - no public members found — org has zero listed public members via `public_members` endpoint

### LinkedIn search-snippet
- "Marie Jones - MBA, Recruiter and Talent Sourcing Guru at ... — Experience Recruiter GE Vernova. Manage full-cycle recruiting and sourcing for 45+ active requisitions across engineering, supply chain, operations, and ..." — https://www.linkedin.com/in/marie-jones-b8089258 (search-snippet only, not scraped)
- "University Recruiter - NAM | GE Vernova | Kellie Nickovich — My team at GE Vernova is growing, and we are looking for a University Recruiter for North America who is as passionate about talent" — https://www.linkedin.com/posts/[REDACTED] (search-snippet only, not scraped)
- "Julie Spicer - Principal Executive Recruiter at GE Vernova" — https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliemspicer (search-snippet only, not scraped) — note: title reads "executive recruiter," likely not relevant to an intern/co-op req
- "Tessa Nguyen - Wind EEDP US Regional Leader — Recruiter for GE Vernova, GE's portfolio of energy businesses. Wing-to-wing recruitment, onboarding &amp; internship program management for leadership programs" — https://www.linkedin.com/in/tessamnguyen (search-snippet only, not scraped) — explicitly mentions internship/leadership-program recruitment
- "Maria Fernandez, MSHRM - Senior Talent Acquisition Partner ... — Senior Talent Acquisition Partner for GE Vernova · Strategic Talent Acquisition professional with 12+ years..." — https://www.linkedin.com/in/[REDACTED] (search-snippet only, not scraped)

(all via `site:linkedin.com GE Vernova recruiter`)

### Careers-page confirmation of the specific role
- Live posting on GE Vernova's own domain: **PCS Application Engineering Co-Op/Intern - Summer 2027**, req `R5050417`, location Findlay, PA, pay $21–34/hr — https://careers.gevernova.com/[REDACTED]/job/R5050417
- This matches the dossier's "Application Engineer Co-op/Intern (PCS)" role and confirms it is real and currently posted on the company's own careers portal (`careers.gevernova.com`), not just a job-board mirror.
- Note: the live posting title says "Summer 2027," which is worth double-checking against the dossier's stated deadline of 2026-10-02 when promoting — the internship term and the application-window deadline are two different dates and both can be correct simultaneously (summer-2027 co-op with a fall-2026 application deadline is a normal GE Vernova pattern), but flagging since I didn't independently verify the deadline date itself, only that the posting is live.

### Notes
- No engineering-blog byline scrape was attempted (search results only, per this task's scope) — gevernova.com/software/blog and gevernova.com/news exist and are real, but no author name surfaced from search snippets alone.
- LinkedIn profile URLs above are search-result titles/descriptions only (`fc_search` snippets) — none of the underlying linkedin.com pages were fetched or scraped, consistent with the hard line against LinkedIn scraping/login walls.
- Tessa Nguyen's snippet is the most on-topic for an internship/early-career req (explicitly mentions "internship program management"), followed by Kellie Nickovich (university recruiting, NAM) — both are stronger candidates for an Application Engineer Co-op contact than the general/executive recruiters (Marie Jones, Julie Spicer, Maria Fernandez, Toni Fiore).
- Hit several Firecrawl 429 rate-limit responses mid-run; all queries eventually succeeded on retry with backoff, no query was silently skipped.</result>

<result>## Contact research: Regions Bank

### Recruiter / university recruiting search
- Jennifer Smith — VP Talent Acquisition Partner at Regions [Bank] — https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferssmith (query: "Regions Bank recruiter")
- Hollie Lofton — Regions Bank (role/title not stated in snippet beyond company) — https://www.linkedin.com/in/hollielofton (query: "Regions Bank recruiter")
- careers.regions.com/us/en/interns — "Interns | Careers at Regions" — official intern program page — https://careers.regions.com/us/en/interns (query: "Regions Bank university recruiting")
- careers.regions.com/us/en/graduates — lists "Technology, ..." as one of the Emerging Talent Program career paths — https://careers.regions.com/us/en/graduates (query: "Regions Bank university recruiting")

### Engineering blog byline
- nothing found — search surfaced Regions' own "Explore Technology" careers page (no author byline) and third-party coverage (futurebranches.wbresearch.com, tearsheet.co, a 10x Banking vendor blog), none of which is a Regions-hosted eng blog post with a named author.

### GitHub org
- no matching public org found — `github_org_members("Regions Bank")` returned no org match via GitHub's org search API.

### LinkedIn search-snippet
- "Jennifer Smith - VP Talent Acquisition Partner at Regions ... — Recruiter with over 20 years experience in corporate recruiting with a heavy emphasis on Executive Placement, Accounting, Finance, Financial Services," — https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferssmith (search-snippet only, not scraped)
- "Catherine Crockett - Regions Bank — As a Senior Talent Acquisition Partner at Regions Bank, I specialize in recruiting top-tier talent within the financial services industry" — https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-crockett1 (search-snippet only, not scraped)

(all via query: "site:linkedin.com Regions Bank recruiter")

### Program-liveness confirmation (careers.regions.com scrape, snippet not scraped past public page)
Scraped `https://careers.regions.com/us/en/interns` (public page, no login wall): page confirms "Regions Emerging Talent Program … Our 2027 internship open positions are now live! We will continue adding positions into September" and a "Fall Virtual Information and Networking Session on September 9th, 2026" — consistent with the dossier's 2026-09-25 deadline and confirms this is a real, currently-open program, not a stale/expired listing. The Technology track specifically is listed under the Graduates/ETP page's career-path list (Consumer Banking, Corporate Banking Group, Finance, Human Resources, Risk Management, Technology, ...) at https://careers.regions.com/us/en/graduates.

### Notes
- All Talent Acquisition contacts found are general Regions Bank recruiters via LinkedIn search-snippet only — none are confirmed as specifically owning the Technology/Operations/Digital/Data Analytics internship track; snippet text alone doesn't disambiguate by function beyond "Finance &amp; Human Resources" (Croak) vs. general/mortgage/retail focus for the others. No name/title should be treated as "the" contact for this specific role without further public confirmation.
- No engineering-blog byline or GitHub org exists for Regions Bank as a distinct, findable public surface — this is typical for a regional bank (not an eng-culture-forward tech company), not a search failure.
- Did not scrape any linkedin.com URL or attempt to view full profiles — stayed at search-snippet text per the hard line.
- Could not locate the dossier file at the path given (`List/Dossiers/Other/Technology, Operations, Digital, and Data Analytics Intern - Regions Bank.md`) in this repo checkout or the sibling `jarvis-checkout` directory (which is present but empty/not checked out) — proceeded using the company name, role, and deadline supplied directly in the task instructions instead.</result>

Regions Bank done — several general Talent Acquisition contacts via LinkedIn snippets, program confirmed live on careers.regions.com.

<result>## Contact research: Genentech (Machine Learning Intern — OpRegen Machine Learning)

### Recruiter / university recruiting search
- Pam Leung — Talent Acquisition Partner (Recruiter), R&amp;D — https://www.linkedin.com/in/pam-leung (query: "Genentech recruiter") — LinkedIn hit surfaced via generic web search, title/description only, not scraped
- Keith Terry — Internal Global Executive Recruiter / Talent Acquisition at Genentech/Roche — https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-terry-3a8a947 (query: "Genentech recruiter")
- No named individual found for "university recruiting" query — results were all careers.gene.com listing pages and a Stanford chemistry-dept event page (query: "Genentech university recruiting")

### Engineering blog byline
- nothing found — "Genentech engineering blog" search returned only careers.gene.com job-listing pages and unrelated third-party sites (genengnews.com trade publication, danaher.com blog); no Genentech-owned blog post with an author byline turned up.

### GitHub org
- org: https://github.com/orgs/Genentech
  - no public members found (`public_members` endpoint returned empty list)

### LinkedIn search-snippet
(source: `linkedin_recruiter_snippet`, query: `site:linkedin.com Genentech recruiter` — snippet text only, never scraped)
- "Pam Leung - Talent Acquisition Partner (Recruiter), R&amp;D" — "Principal Talent Acquisition Partner (Recruiter), R&amp;D · Experience: Genentech · Location: South San Francisco · 500+ connections on LinkedIn." — https://www.linkedin.com/in/pam-leung
- "Keith Terry - Internal Global Executive Recruiter / Talent ..." — "Keith Terry - Internal Global Executive Recruiter / Talent Acquisition at Genentech/Roche. Internal Recruiter exclusively recruiting Executive Level. Identify ..." — https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-terry-3a8a947
- "Chris Melbourne - Talent Acquisition Partner @ Genentech" — "Pragmatic and skilled Talent Acquisition Partner. Strong business acumen within Recruiting, Sourcing, Interviewing, and Onboarding." — https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-melbourne-b6a24b7
- "Nicole Nasri - Principal Talent Partner, Commercial" — "Talent Acquisition Principal - Commercial, Manufacturing and R&amp;D Pharmaceutical. Genentech May 2021 - Present 5 years 4 months" — https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolenasri
- "Kim Crocker - Hire exceptional talent to create a healthier ..." — "Hire exceptional talent to create a healthier future at Genentech! · I am a Talent Partner with over 20 years of corporate experience in pharmaceutical, ..." — https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimecrocker

None of these five are titled specifically as ML/tech/university recruiters — all are general Talent Acquisition / R&amp;D recruiting titles at Genentech, per the search-result snippet text itself. No way to confirm from a snippet alone which (if any) covers this specific req without a deeper search that would cross the no-scrape line, so treat as general Genentech TA contacts, not confirmed as the OpRegen ML req's owner.

### Posting verification
The role is real and live on Genentech's own careers site:
- https://careers.gene.com/us/en/job/202608-121800/[REDACTED] — "2027 Spring Intern - OpRegen Machine Learning" — "Intensive 6 months, full-time (40 hours per week) paid internship... Program start dates are in January 2027 (Spring)." (query: "Genentech OpRegen Machine Learning Intern")
- Same posting mirrored on job boards (linkedin.com/jobs, indeed.com, lensa.com, interninsider.me) confirming it's a genuine, currently-open req — a Jan 2027 start date is consistent with the dossier's 2026-09-08 deadline.

### Notes
- No email inference attempted — no confirmed name/title tied specifically to this req to pair with a domain, and per the "wrong guess is worse than empty" rule I'm not pairing a generic TA-partner name from an unrelated search hit with an inferred email for this specific role.
- Firecrawl search hit a transient 429 rate limit twice mid-session (retried after a short wait, succeeded); no other errors.
- No login walls encountered — all LinkedIn results used only search-snippet text (title/description fields from Firecrawl's search API), the underlying LinkedIn URLs were never fetched, per the hard line in `enrich.py` and this agent's brief.
- Could not locate the dossier file itself in this repo checkout (`List/Dossiers/1 - AI &amp; ML/...` path given in the task doesn't exist in `/home/anant_gupta/projects/work/internship-research-loop`), so I worked directly from the company/role/deadline given in the task rather than reading the dossier's frontmatter.</result>

The dossiers live under `10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/`, not at vault root `List/Dossiers/`. Let me confirm.

Confirmed — the real path is `10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers/`, in the Jarvis vault (not this repo, and not vault root). The dossier paths given in the prompt were relative shorthand missing that prefix. Waiting on DTCC now; I'll fold this path correction into the final report.

**Tool calls:**

- `Bash` — `ls "List/Dossiers/" 2>&1 | head -30; echo "---"; find . -iname "*Regions Bank*" 2>/dev/null; find . -iname "*Genentech*" 2>/dev/null`
  ```
ls: cannot access 'List/Dossiers/': No such file or directory
---
  ```
- `mcp__jarvis__vault_list` — `{"path":"List/Dossiers"}`
- `mcp__jarvis__vault_list` — `{"path":""}`
- `mcp__jarvis__vault_list` — `{"path":"10_Areas/Career/Internships"}`
- `mcp__jarvis__vault_list` — `{"path":"10_Areas/Career/Internships/List"}`

### Recruiter / university recruiting search
- nothing found — `fc_search("DTCC recruiter")` and `fc_search("DTCC university recruiting")` returned only generic career-site pages (dtcc.com/careers, dtcc.com/careers/job-search, dtcc.com/careers/early-career-programs, dtcc.com/careers/experienced-professionals, DTCC's Oracle Cloud candidate-experience jobs board) — no named individual in any result title/description. (`dtcc.edu` hits excluded as noise: that's Delaware Technical Community College, an unrelated institution, not this DTCC.)

### Engineering blog byline
- **Dan Thieke — Managing Director and Head of Enterprise Resiliency, DTCC** — https://dtcc-connection.medium.com/[REDACTED] (byline: "By Dan Thieke, Managing Director and Head of Enterprise Resiliency, DTCC", scraped from dtcc-connection.medium.com, found via `fc_search("DTCC engineering blog")`)
- **Marc Masri — DTCC Executive Director, Infrastructure Enablement** — https://dtcc-connection.medium.com/[REDACTED] (byline: "By Marc Masri, DTCC Executive Director, Infrastructure Enablement" — role title directly overlaps this dossier's Infrastructure area, scraped from dtcc-connection.medium.com, found via `fc_search("DTCC engineering blog")`)

### GitHub org
- org: https://github.com/DTCC (matched via GitHub search API for "DTCC type:org")
- no public members listed — `github_org_members("DTCC")` returned an empty member list for this org (public_members endpoint returned none)

### Notes
- Careers-page confirmation the program is real/live: `dtcc.com/careers/early-career-programs` (scraped directly) states DTCC runs a "competitive summer internship program... in Chennai, India; Manila, Philippines, and in several locations in the U.S. (Jersey City, Dallas, Tampa and Boston)" with an EDGE recruiting timeline of "August–October: Applications open" — consistent with this dossier's 2026-10-01 deadline. DTCC's live Oracle Cloud candidate site (`ebxr.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1/jobs`) currently lists 314 open DTCC roles including an "Information Technology" category (254 openings), confirming the careers pipeline is active, but the site's job search is JS-filtered and the scrape couldn't isolate the exact "Infrastructure Engineer Intern [2027 Intern Program]" requisition by keyword — could not confirm that specific req ID is still open as of today via this route.
- Third-party job-board mirrors (bebee.com, jobright.ai, extern.com, beyondberea.org) all show the identical "Infrastructure Engineer Intern [2027 Intern Program]" / "2027 Summer Program" listing text, corroborating the dossier's role title and program cycle are genuinely circulating — these are mirrors, not primary sources, so not reported as contacts, only as corroboration.
- No LinkedIn profile pages were fetched — only Firecrawl's search-result snippet text was used, per the hard line in `enrich.py` and this agent's instructions.
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` was set and used for all `fc_search`/`fc_scrape` calls (hit transient 429 rate-limiting mid-run; retried with backoff, no other issues).</result>

All six research agents are done. Summary for the 7-item list (Castleton reused from vault, six freshly researched):

**Path correction, flag first:** The dossier paths in the prompt (`List/Dossiers/...`) don't exist — neither in this repo nor at vault root. The real location is `10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers/...` in the Jarvis vault. All six research agents worked from the company/role/deadline given directly rather than reading the dossier files, since the paths as given didn't resolve — the underlying research should still be sound, but confirm role/deadline against the actual dossier file before promoting.

| # | Company | Best contact lead | Program confirmed live? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Castleton Commodities Intl | **Reused from vault** — Lauren Haymond (Global Head of Talent Strategy) / Alissa Turpin (Head Recruiter), both from prior CCI promotions | Yes — cci.com/careers |
| 2 | KeyBank | Tanya Henderson, Sr. Recruiter (LinkedIn snippet); rate-limited on the dedicated LinkedIn query, worth a retry | Yes — key.com, matches dossier role name |
| 3 | Genentech | No req-specific contact found; 5 general TA/R&D recruiters via LinkedIn snippet (Pam Leung, Keith Terry, etc.) — none confirmed as owning this specific req | Yes — careers.gene.com, Jan 2027 start |
| 4 | LPL Financial | **Lauren Walters**, Sr. Recruiter (present-tense title, LinkedIn snippet) — best candidate | Yes — career.lpl.com, 10-week paid program |
| 5 | Regions Bank | No req-specific contact; 5 general TA partners via LinkedIn snippet — none confirmed as owning Tech/Ops/Data track | Yes — careers.regions.com, 2027 postings open now |
| 6 | DTCC | **Rupal Patel** / **Jeffrey Soares**, Talent Acquisition (IT-recruiting-focused) via LinkedIn snippet; also two engineering-blog bylines (Dan Thieke, Marc Masri) if a warmer intro angle is wanted | Yes — dtcc.com/careers, Aug–Oct application window matches deadline |
| 7 | GE Vernova | **Tessa Nguyen** / **Kellie Nickovich**, university/internship-program recruiters via LinkedIn snippet | Yes — careers.gevernova.com, exact req R5050417 live |

None fabricated — every name has a source (LinkedIn search-snippet or engineering-blog byline), and Genentech/Regions Bank honestly came back without a role-specific contact rather than a forced guess. All LinkedIn data is snippet-only, no profiles were scraped.

## Contact research: Genentech (Machine Learning Intern — OpRegen Machine Learning)

Already delivered in full in my previous message — no changes based on this notification. Summary for reference:

- **Recruiter search**: Pam Leung, Keith Terry — general Genentech Talent Acquisition/R&amp;D recruiters, sourced from LinkedIn search-snippets only (not scraped), not confirmed as owners of this specific req.
- **Engineering blog byline**: nothing found.
- **GitHub org**: `github.com/orgs/Genentech` exists, zero public members.
- **LinkedIn search-snippet**: 5 hits (Pam Leung, Keith Terry, Chris Melbourne, Nicole Nasri, Kim Crocker), all general TA partners, snippet text only.
- **Posting verification**: confirmed live at `careers.gene.com/us/en/job/202608-121800/[REDACTED]`, mirrored on LinkedIn/Indeed/Lensa — Jan 2027 start, consistent with the Sept 2026 deadline.
- No email inferred — no name is confirmed tied to this specific req.</result>

## Claude

This is a duplicate notification (same agent as before, re-confirming its earlier result) — no new information, already covered in my report above. All six research tasks are complete; nothing further pending.

## You

Commit all the changes on this repo, get up to date with all the git commands that are required to run. Push everything and then pull it correctly. Without messing anything up

## Claude

Everything looks legitimate — real code, real tests, no secrets. Let's run the test suite before committing, then commit, then integrate the 6 remote commits.

All 444 tests pass. Now committing.

No file overlap between the two sides — remote's 6 commits only touch `logs/` and `state/` (automated CI state), local commits touch code/tests/graphify-out. Safe to rebase.

Rebase succeeded cleanly, no conflicts. Verifying tests still pass and status is clean before pushing.

Now ahead 2, behind 0. Running tests once more against the rebased tree before pushing.

All 444 tests still pass. Pushing.

Pushed successfully. Now pulling to confirm everything is in sync, then handling the stashed graphify-out regeneration.

Done — everything's synced correctly.

**Summary:**
- Committed all working-tree changes (schema-drift coverage for 6 new sources, zero-match-rate alerting, CLAUDE.md addendum, `.cursor/` mirrors, ignore files) — 444 tests passed before and after.
- Rebased cleanly onto the 6 commits that had landed on `origin/master` in the meantime (CI's automated state/log updates) — no conflicts, since the two sides touched entirely disjoint files.
- Pushed; local `master` and `origin/master` now point at the identical commit (`2fa8b76`).

Two things left as-is, not touched:
1. **`graphify-out/` has an unstaged local diff** — a background graphify watcher hook keeps regenerating the graph after every commit/rebase, and it's still firing. It's a local build artifact, not tracked-code drift, so I left it uncommitted rather than chase a moving target — let it settle and commit separately if you want it included.
2. **Two stash entries exist** (`stash@{0}` from this session, `stash@{1}` pre-dating it, both older graphify-out regen snapshots) — left untouched per the no-discard-without-asking rule; nothing in them is needed since their real content (the CLAUDE.md change) is already committed and pushed.

**Tool calls:**

- `Bash` — `git status`
  ```

Add per-source schema drift checks (Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever/Freehire/AIJobs/InternDock) and zero-match-rate alerting

Extends core/schema_drift.py to cover the 6 sources that previously had no
pre-fetch drift check, and adds a per-source zero-match streak alert in
run_pipeline.py (Task 2/3, Prompt 19) — built from the real 2026-08-21..08-28
Ashby zero-match investigation where a source silently produced no matches
for 115 runs before a human noticed by hand. Also adds Cursor-editor mirrors
of the existing Claude Code skills/rules and standard ignore files.

 - **Review** (`/review-loop-change`) → skill, not an agent, and not more Python. The checklist is fixed and known in advance (four conventions, unlikely to grow much), and the repo's small diff size doesn't need an isolated agent context — see that skill's own "why a skill" section. A script *could* grep for some of this (e.g. flagging LLM imports in unattended-path files), but "does this new regex cite real data" needs actual reading comprehension a lint rule doesn't have.
 
 If a new piece of recurring toil shows up and it's mechanical/deterministic (another source feed, another filter rule), it's still Python first, same as everything in `core/` and `ingestion/` today — don't reach for an agent out of habit once a human's judgment isn't actually the bottleneck.
