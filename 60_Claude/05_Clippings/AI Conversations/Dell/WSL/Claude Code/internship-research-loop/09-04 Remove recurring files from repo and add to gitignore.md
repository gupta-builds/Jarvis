## You

I do not want to repeat fully jave files that constantly keep changing on the published github repo, remove these recurring files from the published git repo. Make sure that you add these notes or folders to @.gitignore file. I want all the recurring files created from graphify for auto improving the notes to be ingored, ruin commands for a run as well, get familair with the most recent changes done to the codebase. Run these commands with knowledge, do not simply guess these commands. Make no mistakes with the task provided over here to you. Here are few files that are recurring: "1. graphify-out/.graphify_labels.json, 2. graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md, 3. graphify-out/graph.html, 4. graphify-out/graph.json, 5. graphify-out/manifest.json". Take a look at the recent commits that were done and based on that only act on files to add to the ignore file.

## Claude

Now up to date with origin. Confirmed via history that these 5 files churn on nearly every commit (commit 2fa8b76 rewrote all of them again, right after they were first added in 89fd543). Now untracking them and updating `graphify-out/.gitignore`.

Now untracking the files from git (keeping the local copies since graphify still needs them):

Local files are intact (untouched, still on disk for graphify's Jarvis-sync workflow), git now ignores all five. Committing this change.

Committed locally, working tree clean. This is now ahead of `origin/master` by 1 commit — pushing is what actually removes these files from the published GitHub repo, so confirming before I do that.

Pushed. The 5 files (`.graphify_labels.json`, `GRAPH_REPORT.md`, `graph.html`, `graph.json`, `manifest.json`) are now untracked from the public GitHub repo, listed in `graphify-out/.gitignore`, and still present locally for graphify's own vault-sync workflow. Pre-push test hook ran clean (444 passed).

This reverses an earlier decision (commit 89fd543) to track them — worth remembering so I don't re-add them later.

Done. Summary:

- Fast-forwarded local `master` to origin first (it was 5 commits behind on unrelated `recheck.py` log commits), confirming no conflict with the graphify-out files.
- Verified from `git log` that the 5 files churn on essentially every commit (e.g. commit `2fa8b76` rewrote all of them, +13419 lines to `graph.json` alone, on an unrelated schema-drift change).
- Added the 5 files to `graphify-out/.gitignore` (extending the existing churn-ignore file, matching this repo's convention of citing real evidence next to each rule).
- `git rm --cached` the 5 files — untracked from git, left untouched on disk (graphify still needs them locally for the Jarvis vault sync).
- Committed and pushed (`24ce10a`) after your confirmation.

Local memory updated so a future session doesn't re-add these files to git.

**Tool calls:**

- `Bash` — `echo "--- git status ---" && git status && echo "--- log for graphify-out ---" && git log --oneline -- graphify-out/ | head -20 && echo "--- ls graphify-out ---" && ls -la graphify-out/ && echo "--- tracked files in graphify-out ---" && git ls-files graphify-out/`
  ```

Date:   Sat Aug 22 13:19:35 2026 +0400

    Add graphify knowledge graph output, gitignore its churn
    
    graphify-out/ tracks the codebase knowledge graph (graph.json,
    GRAPH_REPORT.md, graph.html, manifest.json, curated community labels)
    that stays live-synced to the Jarvis vault via git hooks. Excludes the
    extraction cache, machine-local interpreter/root markers, and two
    confirmed-churning artifacts: graphify's own dated backup snapshot
    (graphify-out/<YYYY-MM-DD>/, rewritten on every rebuild) and cost.json
    (per-run token log, inconsistently written under the hook-driven
    incremental rebuild path).

    Add per-source schema drift checks (Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever/Freehire/AIJobs/InternDock) and zero-match-rate alerting
    
    Extends core/schema_drift.py to cover the 6 sources that previously had no
    pre-fetch drift check, and adds a per-source zero-match streak alert in
    run_pipeline.py (Task 2/3, Prompt 19) — built from the real 2026-08-21..08-28
    Ashby zero-match investigation where a source silently produced no matches
    for 115 runs before a human noticed by hand. Also adds Cursor-editor mirrors
    of the existing Claude Code skills/rules and standard ignore files.

Stop tracking graphify-out's regenerated graph files, gitignore them

graph.json, GRAPH_REPORT.md, graph.html, manifest.json, and
.graphify_labels.json were tracked in 89fd543 on the theory that a synced
graph snapshot was worth versioning. Reverted: the very next commit
(2fa8b76) rewrote all five on a routine code change (graph.json alone:
+13419 lines), and every subsequent commit has repeated that - pure
regenerated-on-every-rebuild churn against a public repo, not reviewable
history. Untracked with git rm --cached (working copies untouched -
graphify still keeps them live-synced to the Jarvis vault via git hooks
independent of whether git itself tracks them).

name: graphify-out-untracked
description: graphify-out's main graph files (graph.json, GRAPH_REPORT.md, graph.html, manifest.json, .graphify_labels.json) are gitignored, not committed
metadata:
  type: project
---

As of 2026-09-04, `graphify-out/graph.json`, `GRAPH_REPORT.md`, `graph.html`, `manifest.json`, and `.graphify_labels.json` are untracked from git and listed in `graphify-out/.gitignore` (commit 24ce10a).

**Why:** these were originally committed on purpose (89fd543, 2026-08-22) as a "synced graph snapshot worth versioning." That call was reverted because the very next commit (2fa8b76) rewrote all five on a routine unrelated code change — confirming they churn on every rebuild against this public repo (gupta-builds/internship-research-loop), not reviewable history. The user asked explicitly to stop this.

**How to apply:** don't re-add these 5 files to git tracking, and don't remove them from `graphify-out/.gitignore`, even if a future session sees them as untracked/modified and is tempted to `git add` them back. The local copies stay live-synced to the Jarvis vault via git hooks independent of git tracking, so nothing is lost by ignoring them. See [[graphify-jarvis-sync]] for how that sync works.

## You

Write a basic prompt for an in dpth session with 81% context to read through the notes just created using graphify and note them down inside obsidian, make the detailed folder inside in sync (i believe this action is a repetitive action that takes place every 15 mins or so), verify that this process is taking place by going through the logs or whatever process that you need to take a look at. After that, go through the notes created just now to write a prompt for that in depth session that we were talking about. This prompt should short and for the model sonnet 5, follow this prompting guide for writing the promp: "https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/[REDACTED]". The prompt should read through these to further great notes inside obsidian. Mention these obsidian notes as place holders [] in the prompt. Wherte i have to enter information of these notes. The prompt should update the system regardin the stop taken right now, so that we write excellent processes for a review process in detail to take place, refine our tests, further improve the daily run that barely gets 1 or max 3 internships. We need to also organizes all the dossiers that we recorded so far. Some were deletewd and gone through in detail, some of them were created as program and tracker npotes. None, were created as applying notes but the base for everything was laid out just now. We need take a review in deoth of the runs that took place so we further enhance this process. But our main goal is to further increase our dossier push, applying, program generating, tracker noting, outreach happening and everything very quickly. The main goal now is to start fresh from prompt 1. The first view prompts we change through our current way too many tests per dossier and make the existing process much more rich based on the postmortem and other notes already revelant. Each dossier will have 5 internships aditions each hour ande regarding this process to take place further notes have been created. So that's going to be the first thing we do, we need wrap up our repair rpcoess and deploy a perfedct v0 outside to the internet with a published readme, a professional link prov iding readme and everything ready for anyone to use but may not be specifically focussed on my findings. Just any findings at all that are taking place, a cleart and definitive way to check whether we are able to gather each and everey single internship from our resources, these internships keep on getting added, removed, updated based on existing guideleines. So, that is the end goal. Write me an excellent prompt over here for an in depth session to write these notes, make sure the note has placeholders in them. Clearly state the goal, do not make the model hallucinate and stick the right set of words. The model does it's best work over here so we make sure that we use this correctly.

## Claude

Two corrections before the prompt — both matter for what you send to the next session:

**The sync isn't on a 15-minute timer.** It's three git hooks (`post-commit`, `post-checkout`, `post-merge` in `.git/hooks/`) that fire only when a commit/checkout/merge happens on this machine — there's no cron or systemd timer (checked `crontab -l` and `systemctl --user list-timers`, neither has one). I confirmed it *did* fire correctly just now: `~/.cache/graphify-jarvis-sync.log` shows a fresh run at 17:48 (matching our commit+push), and 1,011 files under `.../40_Project_Briefs/Internship/` have that same mtime. So it's working, just event-triggered, not time-triggered.

**Vault state right now:** 348 dossiers, 10 Programs/Serious, 4 Programs/Considering, 10 Contacts/Each One, 10 Tracker/Each One (all 10 tracker notes have `result: null` — confirms your "none applying yet" read). `Run Log.md`'s weekly rollup shows written-dossier counts falling off a cliff (143 → 121 → 53 → 39 → 77 → 173 per week across late July–Aug), which backs up the "barely 1-3/day" complaint. There's also an existing postmortem — `20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Discovery Step Postmortem — Write-Starvation Incident (2026-08-26).md` — plus a clipping `60_Claude/05_Clippings/.../08-26 Internship-research-loop postmortem and gaps.md` that's directly relevant.

Here's the kickoff prompt, built per the Sonnet 5 guide (front-load everything in one turn since this needs to run mostly autonomously; be literal about scope since Sonnet 5 won't generalize a rule you don't state):

Here's the prompt — paste it as the first message of a fresh session:

```text
Effort: xhigh. This is a fresh start on internship-research-loop — read CLAUDE.md and PRD.md first, they govern everything below (zero-LLM unattended path, permissive-by-default filtering, fail-closed write-gate order, cite-real-data-per-rule).

GOAL: the daily/hourly pipeline is currently writing ~1-3 dossiers/day (see logs/runs.jsonl and the Jarvis vault's Run Log.md weekly rollup — it fell from 143/week to ~40/week between late July and August). Target: 5 new dossiers/hour, sustainably, without loosening the eligibility gates that make this safe to run unattended. Ship a v0 that's genuinely usable by anyone (not tuned to my personal profile/resume), with a professional public README, deployable, and a clear, verifiable way to confirm it's actually catching every live posting from its sources (added/updated/removed correctly) — not just "trust the logs."

READ FIRST (ground every claim in these, cite file+line or timestamp for any finding — do not assert something these don't support):
- Discovery Step Postmortem — Write-Starvation Incident (2026-08-26).md (Jarvis vault, 20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/)
- 08-26 Internship-research-loop postmortem and gaps.md (Jarvis vault, 60_Claude/05_Clippings/AI Conversations/Windows/Claude Code/Jarvis/)
- Jarvis vault's Run Log.md (10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/) — weekly throughput trend
- logs/runs.jsonl, logs/rechecks.jsonl, state/dossier_uids.json (this repo) — actual per-run numbers
- The graphify knowledge-graph mirror at 60_Claude/40_Project_Briefs/Internship/ in the Jarvis vault (GRAPH_REPORT.md and the per-node notes) — use this to find real coupling/dead-code/duplication in core/, ingestion/, vault_writer/ before proposing changes
- [PASTE: any other notes, dossier examples, or context you want read — leave blank if none]

TASKS, in order:
1. Audit why throughput collapsed: walk logs/runs.jsonl week-over-week, cross-reference against the postmortem's stated root cause(s), confirm or refute against current code (not the postmortem's memory of it).
2. Test suite: report where per-dossier/per-source test count has grown disproportionately to logic (current: 444 tests). Propose consolidation that keeps coverage of every gate in vault_writer/validate.py and core/filter.py's negative-signal rules, cutting redundant near-duplicate cases.
3. Propose a concrete plan to hit 5 dossiers/hour without weakening any gate — more sources, better dedup, parallel fetch, whatever the audit actually supports. No speculative rewrites; cite the bottleneck you found in step 1 for each change.
4. Vault housekeeping: of the 348 dossiers, 10 Programs/Serious + 4 Considering, 10 Contacts, 10 Tracker (all result: null) — propose how promotion/outreach should scale alongside higher dossier volume, without touching /promote-dossier's human-consent gate.
5. Draft the public v0 README: setup, config, what "eligible" means (generic, not my criteria), and a way for a stranger to verify capture completeness against a source.

Output a written plan first (root causes cited, changes proposed, each tied to evidence from the reads above) — do not start editing core/, ingestion/, or vault_writer/ until I confirm it.
```

Fill the one bracketed placeholder if you want more read in; otherwise leave it and start the session.

## You

The session has provided me with rich notes inside jarvis, go through the notes existing right now and after that verify this reply provided by that session: "Prompt 27 (Batch B, 7 dossiers) never landed in the vault at all, despite the prompt file's own record describing both 26 and 27 as run — a real discrepancy between documented intent and live state.". Was this really not liad out? Why was this avoided? Look at the previous state of the note: `20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts` when it had the prompt that is mentioned. I want to understand why this was not liad out, so for that go through he noptes that were just made or improved. Gather content that clear;y laid out. If it was not built out, go ahead and do it now. But before building it out, tell me what exactly it is that was not build and why. After understanding the task ind etail, go ahead and do it and prvide me with a detailed summary on what exactly was built out now.

## Claude

"08-30 Intern applications round 2.md" — this looks directly relevant. Reading it now.

## What Wasn't Built, and Why — Verified

**The claim is true, confirmed two independent ways.**

**Batch A (Prompt 26, 8 dossiers) — fully landed.** All 8 have Program + Contact + Tracker notes, and Jarvis's own git history has one commit (`84acd694`, 2026-08-31 00:29) that adds exactly those 16 files (8 Contact + 8 Tracker notes) — nothing more, nothing less.

**Batch B (Prompt 27, 7 dossiers) — zero landed.** None of the 7 company/role names exist anywhere in `Programs/Serious/`, `Programs/Considering/`, `Contacts/Each One/`, or `Tracker/Each One/`. The KeyBank one sits in `List/Dossiers/Viewed/` (looked at, never promoted); the other 6 are untouched in their original bucket folders. No commit in the 2026-08-29–31 window touches those paths at all.

**Why:** I found the actual session — `08-30 Intern applications round 2.md` (session `723a68b4`, 19:46–20:19). It did real work: caught that the dossier paths in the prompt were wrong (missing the `10_Areas/Career/Internships/` prefix — a genuine bug worth flagging separately), reused Castleton's existing contact research, and launched 6 `contact-researcher` agents in parallel for KeyBank, Genentech, LPL Financial, Regions Bank, DTCC, and GE Vernova. **All 6 came back with real, sourced findings** — named recruiters with LinkedIn citations, two DTCC engineering-blog bylines, live-posting confirmation on every company's own careers domain. That's `/promote-dossier`'s research step (Step 3), done properly, for all 7.

Then the human's next message in that same session pivoted it entirely: *"Commit all the changes on this repo... Push everything and then pull it correctly."* That's the exact schema-drift/zero-match-alerting commit (`2fa8b76`) from earlier context — the session spent its remaining ~500 lines on git rebase/stash/push mechanics and never came back to Step 2 (target-folder question) or Step 4 (the actual write) for any of the 7. Its own auto-logged footer confirms it: *"Files created: (none), Files modified: (none), Files deleted: (none)."* Real research, zero write — a redirected session, not a bug or a declined consent.

**The good news: the research doesn't need to be redone.** It's real, cited, and sitting in that log. I can go straight to `/promote-dossier`'s remaining steps.

Following the skill's own consent gate (target folder + bucket confirmation before any write):

All 7 → Serious, all buckets kept as classified. Here's the contact research already gathered (real, sourced, never re-run — reused from the 08-30 session so nothing is refetched or guessed):

| Dossier | Best contact lead | Program confirmed live? |
|---|---|---|
| Castleton — Data Engineering Intern | Reused from vault: Lauren Haymond / Alissa Turpin | Yes — cci.com/careers |
| KeyBank — Analytics & Quant Modeling | Tanya Henderson, Sr. Recruiter (LinkedIn snippet) | Yes — key.com, matches role name |
| Genentech — ML Intern (OpRegen) | No req-specific contact; 5 general TA/R&D recruiters (LinkedIn snippet) | Yes — careers.gene.com, Jan 2027 start |
| LPL Financial — Software Engineer Intern | Lauren Walters, Sr. Recruiter (LinkedIn snippet) | Yes — career.lpl.com |
| Regions Bank — Tech/Ops/Digital/Data Analytics | No req-specific contact; 5 general TA partners (LinkedIn snippet) | Yes — careers.regions.com, 2027 postings open |
| DTCC — Infrastructure Engineer Intern | Rupal Patel / Jeffrey Soares (LinkedIn); Dan Thieke / Marc Masri (eng-blog bylines) | Yes — dtcc.com/careers, Aug–Oct window |
| GE Vernova — Application Engineer Co-op (PCS) | Tessa Nguyen / Kellie Nickovich, university recruiters | Yes — careers.gevernova.com, req R5050417 |

Note the Castleton deadline (2026-09-01) has already passed — I'll note that honestly in its Tracker note rather than pretending otherwise; promoting it still gets the research/contact captured for the record.

Now writing all 21 notes (7 dossiers × Program/Contact/Tracker), reusing the real research already gathered rather than re-running it.

Company 1/7 done. Continuing with KeyBank (note: this posting expired *today*, flagging that honestly).

2/7 done. Genentech next.

3/7 done. LPL Financial next (reusing the sibling LPL company research).

4/7 done. Regions Bank next (flagging the 10-vs-11-week discrepancy honestly).

5/7 done. DTCC next.

6/7 done. GE Vernova last.

Now closing the loop: adding the missing "Result" record to the Archive (the very gap that caused this confusion), so a future session doesn't hit the same question.

## Summary

**Confirmed the claim was true**, root-caused it, and built the missing work.

**What was verified:** Batch A (Prompt 26, 8 dossiers) fully landed — one commit, `84acd694`, has all 16 files. Batch B (Prompt 27, 7 dossiers) had **zero** Program/Contact/Tracker notes anywhere in the vault, confirmed by direct file lookup and by the git history showing no commit ever touched those paths.

**Why:** The actual session ran (`08-30 Intern applications round 2.md`, 19:46–20:19) and did real work — caught a path bug in the prompt, reused existing Castleton research, and successfully ran all 6 remaining `contact-researcher` agents with genuine, sourced findings. Then the human's next message in that same session redirected it entirely to an unrelated git commit/push task (the schema-drift commit `2fa8b76`) — the session never returned to actually write the notes. Its own logged footer confirmed: zero files created.

**What I built** (all 7, following `/promote-dossier`'s consent gate — you confirmed Serious/Considering per dossier and gave final write consent):

21 new notes — Program + Contact + Tracker for each of: Castleton (Data Engineering Intern), KeyBank (Analytics & Quant Modeling), Genentech (ML Intern), LPL Financial (Software Engineer Intern), Regions Bank, DTCC, GE Vernova. All reused the real 2026-08-30 contact research rather than re-running it (no wasted API calls).

Honesty flags built into the notes rather than hidden:
- **KeyBank's posting expired the same day I promoted it** (2026-09-04) — flagged prominently, framed as record-keeping not an active target.
- **Castleton's deadline (2026-09-01) had already passed** — flagged, with a suggestion to ask the existing CCI contacts about a late application.
- **Regions Bank's posting contradicts itself** (says both "10 weeks" and "11 weeks" duration) — flagged as a real source discrepancy, not resolved by guessing.
- **DTCC's specific req** couldn't be independently re-confirmed live through the company's own JS-filtered job search — flagged to verify before prepping further.

Also corrected the record itself: added the missing "Result" block to Prompt 27's Archive entry (the actual gap that caused this confusion), and a dated correction to the Prompt 1 Reboot note's now-stale vault-state numbers (10→17 Programs/Serious, 10→17 Contacts/Tracker, still 0 Applying notes) — following this project's own no-silent-edits convention.

**Tool calls:**

# /promote-dossier

Promotes one dossier from `List/Dossiers/` (auto-written by this repo's discovery loop) into `Programs/`, `Contacts/Each One/`, and `Tracker/Each One/` — Step 3 ("Commit") of the Jarvis vault's `30_Order/Workflows/Internship Pipeline.md`. This is a human-in-the-loop step: it never writes anything without an explicit go-ahead, and it never invents a fact it can't source.

## Prerequisite — read this before running

**This skill needs a session with both this repo and the Jarvis vault (`gupta-builds/Jarvis`) present in the same working environment.** This repo's own automation (`run_pipeline.py`, `recheck.py`) never touches the vault interactively — it writes once, non-interactively, via a scoped PAT in CI. This skill is the opposite shape: a human reviewing real findings before a write happens, which means it needs to actually read and write vault files directly, not through a second automated writer.

Two ways that access can exist, and this skill works with either — but do not assume either one silently, check first:

1. **Git checkout, sibling to this repo** — the layout this repo's own code already expects (`run_pipeline.py`'s `JARVIS_DIR` env var, same pattern as `jarvis-checkout/` in CI). Expected layout:
   ```
   internship-research-loop/     <- this repo
   Jarvis/                       <- gupta-builds/Jarvis, checked out alongside it
   ```
   If this is how the vault is reachable, use plain `Read`/`Edit`/`Write` on paths under `../Jarvis/` (or wherever it's actually checked out — ask if it's not obviously sibling), and use `git status`/`git diff` in that checkout before committing so the human can see exactly what's about to be written, same review discipline as any other repo.
2. **Obsidian MCP tools** (`jarvis`, `jarvis-fs` in this session's `.claude/settings.json` — confirmed connected in this repo as of 2026-07-26) — if Obsidian is running locally with its Local REST API plugin enabled, `mcp__jarvis__vault_read` / `vault_write` / `vault_patch` reach the live vault directly. This is what was actually used to verify this skill's templates against the real vault. It does not require a separate git checkout, but it does require Obsidian to actually be open with that plugin active — don't assume it's connected just because the tools are listed; call `mcp__jarvis__vault_list` first and confirm it returns real vault content before proceeding.

If neither is available, **stop and tell the user** — don't guess at paths or fabricate vault content from memory of what this document says the vault contains.

**Do not attempt to write across the two repos via the GitHub API** (`mcp__github__create_or_update_file` etc.) as a substitute for either path above. `core/git_ops.py` in this repo exists specifically to solve the two-writer collision problem (this pipeline's own CI + the vault's own independent auto-commit cycle) for the one automated writer this pipeline has. Adding a second interactive writer that pushes through a different mechanism (the API instead of a local checkout + normal git) reintroduces exactly that race with no equivalent retry/rebase handling. If you find yourself reaching for the GitHub API here, stop — that's a sign this prerequisite isn't actually met, not a reason to route around it.

## Note templates

Read `reference/note-templates.md` before writing anything — it has the exact, required frontmatter for all three note types (Program, Contact, Tracker/Each One), copied from the vault's own `Program Template.md` / `Contact Template.md` where those exist, and authored from `Internship Pipeline.md`'s own field description where (Tracker/Each One) no template exists yet. These are enforced contracts, not loose guidance — every required field must be present on every note, even as `null`.

## Steps

### 1. Take the input
Accept a dossier file path, or a company/title to search for under `List/Dossiers/` (recursively — dossiers are sorted into priority-bucket subfolders `1 - AI & ML/`, `2 - Fullstack/`, `3 - CyS & Finance/`, `Other/`, per `core/classify.py`'s `BUCKET_FOLDERS`). Read the dossier's frontmatter and body, including its classification callout (the `> [!NOTE] <bucket>: ...` line in the body — dossiers don't carry a `category` frontmatter field, per `vault_writer/writer.py`'s `build_frontmatter()`, so the callout text and the folder it's filed under are the only record of the auto-assigned bucket).

### 2. Ask two concrete questions
Use `AskUserQuestion` with exactly these two questions — not open-ended prose:

- **(a) Target folder**: `Programs/Serious/` or `Programs/Considering/`. Per the pipeline doc, this is a preference/timing split only, never a rigor split — don't imply one is a lesser commitment than the other in how you phrase it. No default is auto-derivable here (nothing upstream computes "serious vs. considering"), so present both options on equal footing.
- **(b) Priority/category override**: state the dossier's auto-assigned bucket (from the classification callout / folder) as the **default answer**, and offer "keep as classified" alongside an explicit override option (with the three other buckets as alternatives, or "Other"). Don't force the human to retype the bucket name if they're keeping it — "keep as classified" should be a single selectable option, not something they have to spell out.

### 3. Invoke contact research and show findings — before writing anything
Launch the `contact-researcher` subagent (`.claude/agents/contact-researcher.md`) with the dossier's company name. Its job is exploratory — real, sourced findings or an honest "nothing found," never a guess — which is exactly why it's a subagent here rather than a script (see that file's own docstring for why). Do not call `enrich.py`'s `main()` CLI directly from this skill: that function writes an "## Enrichment" section straight into the dossier file as a side effect the moment it runs, which would be exactly the silent, pre-consent write this skill exists to avoid. The subagent uses `enrich.py`'s underlying functions (`fc_search`, `github_org_members`, `linkedin_recruiter_snippet`, etc.) without that write.

Show the subagent's full structured output to the human as-is — company info, contacts found (with source), LinkedIn search-snippet hits, or the honest "nothing found" for any category that came up empty. This is a checkpoint, not a formality: the human needs to actually see this before deciding to proceed.

### 4. On explicit go-ahead only, write all three notes together
Ask plainly: "Write the Program, Contact, and Tracker notes now?" A yes/no, not implied by silence or by having answered the two questions in step 2 — answering those questions is not the same as authorizing the write.

On yes:
1. Create any missing folder (`Programs/Considering/`, `Contacts/Each One/`, `Tracker/Each One/` — as of 2026-07-26 none of these three exist in the vault yet, only `Programs/Serious/` does) as part of this same write, not speculatively beforehand.
2. Write the Program note, Contact note, and Tracker/Each One note per `reference/note-templates.md`, cross-linked as documented there (`list_origin`, `recruiter_contact`, `related_programs`, `program`, `contact`, `related_notes`). Before finalizing, run the "Backfill structured fields from the same content the body prose is drawn from" check in `reference/note-templates.md` — a fact narrated in the Eligibility/Traps prose (class year, degree level, a stated date) must also land in its matching frontmatter field, not just the prose; `Programs/Programs MOC.md` sorts and filters on `deadline_real`/`eligible_classes`, so a fact that's only in prose is invisible to it. Fill the Prep Checklist with 3-5 real items grounded in the posting's own stated requirements/duties, not a bare checkbox. Tracker's `date_created` is today, same as `date_researched` — not deferred to a later Applying note.
3. Fold the contact-researcher subagent's real findings (with sources) into the Contact note's Facts section verbatim — don't paraphrase away the citations.
4. Report back the three paths written and a one-line summary of what's now true that wasn't before.

On no (or if the human wants changes): go back to step 2/3 as needed. Never write partial output — if any of the three notes can't be completed (e.g. a required cross-link target doesn't exist yet), stop and say so rather than writing two of three and leaving the third for later.

## What this skill does not do

- Does not create an Applying note (`Internship Pipeline.md` Step 4) — that happens later, only once real application activity starts, and is out of scope here.
- Does not run `enrich.py`'s CLI to append an Enrichment section to the dossier itself. If the human wants that too, tell them it's a separate, optional manual step (`FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=... python enrich.py "<dossier path>"`) — not something this skill does on their behalf, since that's a second write path with its own idempotency story already documented in `enrich.py`.
- Does not push/commit the vault changes. Leave that to the human (or to whatever the vault's own auto-commit cycle already does) unless explicitly asked to, and if asked, follow the same git-safety discipline as anywhere else — show the diff before committing.

# Data Science Machine Learning Intern — Castleton Commodities International
Static research only — comp, eligibility, deadlines, traps, prep. Live status (applied, interview, offer) lives on the matching note in `20_Progress/Internship/Applying/`, linked via `applying_note` above.
## Program Overview
Castleton Commodities International (CCI) is a global energy commodities merchant and infrastructure asset investor. This internship sits on CCI's Global Data Science team (Stamford, CT / Houston, TX), part of a broader "Data Science & Technology" program confirmed live on CCI's own careers page (covering Software Engineering, ML, GenAI, and Data Engineering tracks). Interns work with fundamental market data in Power, Natural Gas, and Oil, building time-series forecasting models (ARIMA/SARIMA, XGBoost, LSTM, linear regression) that feed directly into trading and risk-management decisions.
## Eligibility
Currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree or higher in Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Computer Science, or a related technical field with a focus in Machine Learning. Expected graduation Winter 2027 or Spring/Summer 2028. Requires hands-on ML experience (regression, time-series forecasting, deep learning, reinforcement learning, or predictive modeling) and strong Python (Pandas, NumPy).
## Traps & Gotchas
> [!WARNING]
> The stated deadline — "Application Deadline: September 1, 11:59pm EST" — is firm and very close. CCI's campus recruiting for this program starts in late July, so by the time this posting was captured (2026-07-22) the clock was already running; don't assume a typical "apply anytime before the internship starts" timeline.
## Prep Checklist
- [ ] Review ARIMA/SARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM fundamentals for time-series forecasting — named directly in the posting
- [ ] Prepare a Python/Pandas/NumPy portfolio example involving time-series or financial data if possible
- [ ] Be ready to discuss how ML models could support trading/risk decisions in Power, Natural Gas, or Oil markets — the posting's core stated use case

# Data Engineering Intern — Castleton Commodities International
Static research only — comp, eligibility, deadlines, traps, prep. Live status (applied, interview, offer) lives on the matching note in `20_Progress/Internship/Applying/`, linked via `applying_note` above.
## Program Overview
CCI's Global Data Science & Technology team (Houston, TX / Stamford, CT / NYC) is building out a data platform to support investment decision-making across commodity markets. This Data Engineering Intern role is the pipeline/infrastructure counterpart to the Data Science internship already tracked at [[10_Areas/Career/Internships/Programs/Serious/Data Science Machine Learning Intern - Castleton Commodities International|the sibling CCI Program note]] — same team, same careers page, different track. Interns build and maintain ingestion pipelines (APIs, FTP, cloud providers) and ETL processes into Snowflake, working alongside Data Science, Data Engineering, and Commercial teams.
## Eligibility
Currently pursuing a Bachelor's or higher degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Management Information Systems, or a related technical field. Expected graduation Winter 2027 or Spring/Summer 2028. Strong Python (pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy) and SQL required; cloud platform exposure (AWS, Azure) and web-scraping/large-dataset familiarity are pluses, not hard requirements.
## Traps & Gotchas
> [!WARNING]
> **This posting's own stated deadline — September 1, 11:59pm EST — has already passed as of this note's creation (2026-09-04).** This dossier sat unpromoted since 2026-07-22 (the Prompt 27 batch it was part of was researched on 2026-08-30 but the session that did the research got redirected before writing these notes — see the sibling Batch-A CCI role, which shares this exact deadline and was promoted on time). Treat this as likely closed; confirm directly on the Workday link before investing more prep time, and consider reaching out to Lauren Haymond or Alissa Turpin (see Contact note) to ask whether a late application is still possible given the shared team/timeline with the sibling role.
## Prep Checklist
- [ ] Review building data ingestion pipelines from APIs, FTP endpoints, and cloud data providers — named directly in Responsibilities
- [ ] Prepare a Python + SQL example touching Snowflake or another relational warehouse, ETL/ELT design
- [ ] Be ready to discuss data quality/validation logic (the posting calls out "data quality checks... to identify anomalies")
- [ ] Review workflow orchestration basics (Airflow or similar) — explicitly named
- [ ] Given the deadline has passed, prioritize the outreach angle (Contact note) over further prep unless a late-application path is confirmed

- No matching public GitHub org found for Castleton Commodities International.
- CCI's own careers page (cci.com/careers/students/) confirms a real, live "Data Science & Technology" internship program covering Software Engineering, ML, GenAI, and Data Engineering tracks.
## Current Draft
(No single primary contact identified yet — nothing to draft to.)
## Conversation Log
- **2026-09-04:** Note created via /promote-dossier. Research reused from the sibling CCI Program (same company, researched 2026-08-30) rather than re-run, since it's company-level, not role-specific.
## Next Action
Given the posting deadline (2026-09-01) has passed, reach out to Lauren Haymond or Alissa Turpin to ask whether a late application is still possible for this Data Engineering track, referencing the sibling Data Science/ML role if already in contact about that one.

# Analytics and Quantitative Modeling Intern — KeyBank
Static research only — comp, eligibility, deadlines, traps, prep. Live status (applied, interview, offer) lives on the matching note in `20_Progress/Internship/Applying/`, linked via `applying_note` above.
## Program Overview
KeyBank's Enterprise Internship is a 10.5-week in-person program in Cleveland, OH. This track (Analytics & Quantitative Modeling) places interns into one of several sub-areas — Quantitative Modeling and Advanced Analytics, Model Risk, Market Risk, Client & Employee Experience, Commercial Analytics, or Fraud Analytics — for the internship's duration, working on data/analytics/quant models that feed into risk management and business-strategy decisions.
## Eligibility
Must have completed at least three years toward a four-year undergraduate degree (coursework in math, stats, engineering, finance, economics, CS, business analytics, data science, or related quantitative fields), anticipated graduation May 2028 or December 2027. Minimum 3.3 GPA. Knowledge of statistical techniques/ML approaches and basic AI concepts expected; SQL/SAS/Python/R/Tableau preferred, not required.
## Traps & Gotchas
> [!WARNING]
> **This posting expired today (2026-09-04) — the dossier itself was auto-removed by this repo's daily recheck on 2026-09-04 ("active: false upstream"), and the posting's own stated expiration date was also 09/04/2026.** This dossier was found 2026-08-14 and researched for promotion on 2026-08-30 (contact-researcher agent ran successfully), but the session that did the research was redirected to an unrelated git-housekeeping task before ever writing these notes — this promotion is happening five days after the fact, on the same day the posting closed. Treat this specific req as closed; the value here is the contact research and program-legitimacy confirmation for a future KeyBank cycle, not an active application target.
## Prep Checklist
- [ ] If reopened next cycle: review time-series/quant modeling fundamentals and be ready to discuss statistical technique exposure (SQL/SAS/Python/R/Tableau)
- [ ] Prepare a data-visualization/insight-communication example — posting explicitly calls out "effective data visualizations and insights" for senior management
- [ ] Research which of the 6 placement sub-areas (QMAA, Model Risk, Market Risk, Client & Employee Experience, Commercial Analytics, Fraud Analytics) best fits before any future application
- [ ] Given this req is closed, prioritize confirming with KeyBank's recruiter contacts (see Contact note) whether a 2027-cycle successor posting is expected, rather than prepping for this specific req

# Analytics and Quantitative Modeling Intern — KeyBank
## Facts
- "Jordan M. — Senior Recruiter" — https://www.key.com/about/careers/find-your-career-path/employee-spotlight/jordan.html (KeyBank's own employee-spotlight page; first name + last initial only as published, no fuller name given by the source)
- Tanya Henderson - Senior Recruiter for KeyBank — https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanya-henderson-0210505 (LinkedIn search-snippet only, not scraped; query: `site:linkedin.com KeyBank recruiter`)
- No KeyBank-run engineering blog with an authored byline found (only careers pages and third-party coverage).
- github.com/orgs/cn-keybank/people surfaced as a possible GitHub org match but has no public members and no metadata tying it to the bank — treated as **no matching public org found**, not reported as a real hit, per the "wrong guess is worse than empty" rule.
- Program legitimacy confirmed live on KeyBank's own domain: `key.com/about/careers/students-and-graduates/interns/quant-risk-management-intern.html` ("Quantitative Modeling and Analytics Internship Program"), listed under Strategy & Analytics on KeyBank's intern-programs index.
- The dedicated `linkedin_recruiter_snippet()` query hit Firecrawl 429 rate-limiting on 4 attempts and never returned data — its absence is a tool failure, not a "nothing found"; the Tanya Henderson hit came from a substitute general-search query using the same snippet-only mechanism.
## Current Draft
(No single primary contact identified yet — nothing to draft to; also, the req itself has closed as of 2026-09-04, so no draft is being written until a live successor posting exists.)
## Conversation Log
- **2026-09-04:** Note created via /promote-dossier. Contact research itself ran 2026-08-30 (same day the dossier was slated for promotion) but the write step was delayed — see Program note's Traps section for why.
## Next Action
Posting closed 2026-09-04. Check back for a 2027-cycle successor posting before reaching out to Jordan M. or Tanya Henderson cold.

# Machine Learning Intern (OpRegen Machine Learning) — Genentech
Static research only — comp, eligibility, deadlines, traps, prep. Live status (applied, interview, offer) lives on the matching note in `20_Progress/Internship/Applying/`, linked via `applying_note` above.
## Program Overview
The OpRegen ML team builds machine learning tools to understand the biology behind the OpRegen cell-therapy manufacturing process (an allogeneic hESC-derived therapy for geographic atrophy/advanced dry AMD), replacing infrequent subjective observation with objective, quantitative metrics. The internship centers on Cellestial, Genentech's in-house morphology capability: turning microscopy imaging data into insight (correlating morphological features with phenotypic properties), automating model inference on new data, and building visualization/tooling — working closely with the computational team and wet-lab/Process Development/gRED scientists. Intensive 6-month, full-time (40 hrs/week) paid internship, South San Francisco, on-site, starting January 2027.
## Eligibility
Must be pursuing or have attained an Associate's Degree, OR pursuing a Bachelor's Degree (enrolled), OR have attained a Bachelor's Degree (not currently enrolled in a graduate program), OR pursuing or have attained a Master's Degree. Any quantitative/engineering major (CS, data science, biomedical engineering, computational biology, physics). Requires solid, hands-on ML/deep-learning experience and strong Python; genuine strength in at least one of computer vision, statistics/data analysis, software engineering/MLOps, or data visualization/tooling. PyTorch and HPC (SLURM) experience preferred but not required.
## Traps & Gotchas
> [!WARNING]
> No relocation assistance is provided, and the role is explicitly on-site in South San Francisco — factor cost of living/housing into any decision before applying. Separately, this dossier was researched for promotion on 2026-08-30 (contact-researcher agent completed successfully) but the write step was delayed 5 days by a session redirect — see Contact note's Conversation Log. The 2026-09-08 deadline is still live as of this note's creation (2026-09-04), unlike the sibling KeyBank/Castleton dossiers from the same batch.
## Prep Checklist
- [ ] Be ready to discuss hands-on ML/deep-learning project experience specifically (not just coursework) — posting requires "substantial hands-on experience"
- [ ] Prepare to speak to strength in at least one of: computer vision, statistics/data analysis, software eng/MLOps, or data viz/tooling — the posting frames this as a genuine specialization choice, not a checklist
- [ ] Review PyTorch and image-analysis basics if applicable — explicitly named as preferred
- [ ] Be ready to discuss working in a large, shared Git repository and a complex/mature codebase — explicitly called out as a required skill
- [ ] Research OpRegen / geographic atrophy background to speak knowledgeably about the biology this ML work supports

# Machine Learning Intern (OpRegen Machine Learning) — Genentech
## Facts
- Pam Leung — Talent Acquisition Partner (Recruiter), R&D — https://www.linkedin.com/in/pam-leung (LinkedIn search-snippet only, not scraped; query: `site:linkedin.com Genentech recruiter`)
- Keith Terry — Internal Global Executive Recruiter / Talent Acquisition at Genentech/Roche — https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-terry-3a8a947 (same query)
- Chris Melbourne — Talent Acquisition Partner @ Genentech — https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-melbourne-b6a24b7 (same query)
- Nicole Nasri — Principal Talent Partner, Commercial (Manufacturing/R&D pharma) — https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolenasri (same query)
- Kim Crocker — Talent Partner, 20+ yrs pharmaceutical corporate recruiting — https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimecrocker (same query)
- None of the above five are titled specifically as ML/tech/university recruiters — all general Talent Acquisition/R&D titles; no way to confirm from a snippet alone which (if any) owns this specific req.
- No Genentech-owned engineering blog post with an author byline found ("Genentech engineering blog" search returned only careers.gene.com listings and unrelated third-party sites).
- github.com/orgs/Genentech exists but has zero public members listed.
- Role verified real and live: careers.gene.com/us/en/job/202608-121800/... — "2027 Spring Intern - OpRegen Machine Learning," mirrored on LinkedIn/Indeed/Lensa job boards, Jan 2027 start date consistent with the 2026-09-08 deadline.
- No email inferred — no name confirmed tied specifically to this req, per the "wrong guess is worse than empty" rule.
## Current Draft
(No single primary contact identified yet — nothing to draft to; five general TA contacts are candidates but none confirmed as owning this req.)
## Conversation Log
- **2026-09-04:** Note created via /promote-dossier. Contact research itself ran 2026-08-30 — the session completed all 6 dispatched agents successfully but was redirected to an unrelated commit/push task immediately after, and never returned to write these notes. This promotion (5 dossiers/companies in total, including this one) closes that gap.
## Next Action
Pick one of the five general Genentech TA contacts to reach out to cold, or apply directly via Workday before the 2026-09-08 deadline (4 days out as of this note).

# Software Engineer Intern — LPL Financial Holdings
Static research only — comp, eligibility, deadlines, traps, prep. Live status (applied, interview, offer) lives on the matching note in `20_Progress/Internship/Applying/`, linked via `applying_note` above.
## Program Overview
LPL Financial's Software Engineering internship builds tooling that supports financial advisors and their clients — full-stack web application work (React, Angular, Java, Python, .NET, Node.js), backend APIs/services, and cloud-based applications, alongside experienced engineers and mentors. Explicitly leans into AI-assisted development tools as part of the day-to-day workflow, not just as a nice-to-have skill. This is a sibling role to the Data Engineer Intern track already tracked at [[10_Areas/Career/Internships/Programs/Considering/Data Engineer Intern - Data - LPL Financial Holdings|the existing LPL Program note]] — same company, same 10-week program, same priority-application-date mechanic.
## Eligibility
Currently pursuing a bachelor's or master's degree in computer science, MIS, software engineering, or a related field. Requires hands-on experience (coursework, internships, hackathons, or personal projects) with at least one programming language (Python, Java, C#, or JavaScript). No visa sponsorship available for this early-career program, now or in the future — international students without existing work authorization should not expect to be eligible.
## Traps & Gotchas
> [!WARNING]
> This is a **"priority application" deadline** (September 21, 11:59pm PST), not a hard cutoff — the posting is explicit that hiring decisions will mostly be made following that date but applications are reviewed on a rolling basis, so applying early still matters even though late applications aren't automatically rejected. Separately, this dossier was researched for promotion on 2026-08-30 alongside 6 others but the write step was delayed until now (2026-09-04) — see Contact note.
## Prep Checklist
- [ ] Be ready to discuss experience with at least one of React, Angular, Java, Python, .NET, or Node.js — explicitly named stack
- [ ] Prepare an example of using AI-assisted development tools critically (not just autocomplete) — explicitly called out as a responsibility, not just a nice-to-have
- [ ] Review API/backend service design and secure coding practices basics
- [ ] Have a portfolio example (coursework, hackathon, or personal project) ready to discuss in at least one required language
- [ ] Confirm current U.S. work authorization before applying — no sponsorship available for this program, now or in the future

# Software Engineer Intern — LPL Financial Holdings
## Facts
- Ariel Eason — Executive Recruiter / Senior Recruiter, LPL Financial (linkedin.com/in/ariel-eason-8b499296) — LinkedIn search-snippet only, not scraped; reused from the sibling Data Engineer Intern promotion, same company
- Lauren Walters — Senior Recruiter @ LPL Financial | Strategic Talent Acquisition Partner (linkedin.com/in/laurenpwalters) — LinkedIn search-snippet only, not scraped; also independently surfaced during this role's own 2026-08-30 contact-research pass as the "best candidate" lead
- Sean Stiles — Sr. Recruiter, Talent Acquisition @ LPL Financial, Charlotte Metro — matches one of this posting's target office locations (Fort Mill/Charlotte) — linkedin.com/in/sean-stiles-728a68165 — LinkedIn search-snippet only, not scraped
- Brianna Tate, Matt Vermillion, Shanna Class — additional Senior Recruiter/Talent Acquisition hits at LPL Financial, no location/specialization signal tying them more specifically to this req
- Mark Ashton — appears to be a Global Talent Acquisition Leader overseeing LPL's recruiting team — linkedin.com/in/markashton
- No engineering-blog byline found — LPL's public "blog" (lpl.com/research/blog.html) is investment-research commentary, not engineering.
- No genuine LPL Financial GitHub org found — closest API match (`[REDACTED]`) is a student hackathon team, not LPL's corporate presence.
- Real program pages confirmed: career.lpl.com/internship (10-week paid summer program) and career.lpl.com/early-career-events.
## Current Draft
(No single primary contact identified yet — Sean Stiles is the strongest location match for this Fort Mill/Charlotte/Austin req; nothing drafted until a target is chosen.)
## Conversation Log
- **2026-09-04:** Note created via /promote-dossier. Contact research for this specific role ran 2026-08-30 (Lauren Walters surfaced as best candidate) — reusing the fuller sibling company-level research here since it's the same LPL recruiting org, not re-running from zero. Write step delayed from 2026-08-30 by an unrelated session redirect (see Program note's Traps).
## Next Action
Reach out to Sean Stiles (Charlotte Metro-based, matches a target office location for this specific req) or Lauren Walters first, or apply cold via Workday before the September 21 priority date.

# Technology, Operations, Digital, and Data Analytics Intern — Regions Bank
Static research only — comp, eligibility, deadlines, traps, prep. Live status (applied, interview, offer) lives on the matching note in `20_Progress/Internship/Applying/`, linked via `applying_note` above.
## Program Overview
Part of Regions' Emerging Talent Program (ETP) — interns are placed into one of three potential areas (Data & Analytics including Data Engineering/Management/Science, Digital Banking, or the Financial Crimes Unit) and work on real department assignments in Hoover, AL (Riverchase Operations Center, Birmingham metro). Confirmed live on Regions' own careers page: "Our 2027 internship open positions are now live! We will continue adding positions into September," plus a Fall Virtual Information and Networking Session on 2026-09-09.
## Eligibility
College student pursuing an undergraduate or graduate degree in Business Analytics, Management Information Systems, Engineering, Math, Data Science, or a related degree, with final graduation between December 2027 and May 2029. No work-visa sponsorship — must be currently authorized to work in the US full-time. Preferred minimum 3.0 GPA; Python/SQL/SAS and Power BI/Tableau experience are preferences, not requirements.
## Traps & Gotchas
> [!WARNING]
> **The posting itself contradicts its own stated duration** — one section says "Ability to work 40 hours a week for 10 weeks," a later section says "Ability to work 40 hours a week for 11 weeks onsite in Birmingham, AL." Both are direct quotes from the same posting; this isn't a note-writing error, the source content genuinely disagrees with itself. Confirm the real duration during the interview/offer stage rather than assuming either number. Separately: this dossier was researched for promotion on 2026-08-30 but the write step was delayed until now (2026-09-04) — see Contact note.
## Prep Checklist
- [ ] Decide which of the 3 placement areas (Data & Analytics, Digital Banking, Financial Crimes Unit) is the strongest fit before/during the application — the posting frames this as a real placement choice, not a formality
- [ ] Prepare a Python, SQL, or SAS example if targeting the Data & Analytics track specifically
- [ ] Have a Power BI or Tableau example ready if data visualization is a strength to highlight
- [ ] Be ready to discuss campus leadership/extracurricular involvement — explicitly listed as a skill/competency the posting screens for
- [ ] Clarify the 10-vs-11-week duration discrepancy directly with a recruiter before finalizing any conflicting personal-schedule commitments

## Facts
- Jennifer Smith — VP Talent Acquisition Partner at Regions — https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferssmith (LinkedIn search-snippet only, not scraped; query: `site:linkedin.com Regions Bank recruiter`)
- Catherine Crockett — Senior Talent Acquisition Partner, financial services — https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-crockett1 (same query)
- Caitlin Croak — AVP, Talent Acquisition Partner, Finance & Human Resources — https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlincroak (same query) — closest of the group to a Finance/HR functional match, still not confirmed as owning this specific Technology/Data track

- Hollie Lofton — Regions Bank, retail/program-management specialties — https://www.linkedin.com/in/hollielofton (same query)
- None of the above are confirmed as specifically owning the Technology/Operations/Digital/Data Analytics internship track — snippet text alone doesn't disambiguate by function.
- No Regions-hosted engineering blog with an author byline found; no public GitHub org found for Regions Bank — typical for a regional bank, not a search failure.
- Program-liveness confirmed via direct scrape of careers.regions.com/us/en/interns (public page, no login wall): "Regions Emerging Talent Program... Our 2027 internship open positions are now live! We will continue adding positions into September," plus a Fall Virtual Information and Networking Session on 2026-09-09 — consistent with the 2026-09-25 deadline.
## Current Draft
(No single primary contact identified yet — nothing to draft to.)
## Conversation Log
- **2026-09-04:** Note created via /promote-dossier. Contact research ran 2026-08-30; write step delayed by an unrelated session redirect (see Program note's Traps).
## Next Action
Pick one of the five general Regions Bank TA contacts to reach out to cold, or apply directly via Workday before 2026-09-25. Consider attending the 2026-09-09 Fall Virtual Information/Networking Session first — real, confirmed-live signal, and a lower-friction way to get in front of the recruiting team before applying.

# Infrastructure Engineer Intern [2027 Intern Program] — DTCC
Static research only — comp, eligibility, deadlines, traps, prep. Live status (applied, interview, offer) lives on the matching note in `20_Progress/Internship/Applying/`, linked via `applying_note` above.
## Program Overview
DTCC's Summer Internship Program is a 10-week structured experience for early-career talent (orientation, training, manager engagement, feedback milestones, networking). This Infrastructure Engineer track works on core technology platforms across distributed systems, mainframe, network, private cloud, and public cloud environments — supporting operational resilience, infrastructure automation, cloud adoption, and production readiness for financial-market infrastructure. Locations: Jersey City NJ, Tampa FL, or Dallas/Coppell TX. Hybrid: 3 days in office, 2 remote.
## Eligibility
Currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, IT, Cybersecurity, Network Engineering, MIS, Cloud Computing, Data Science, Electrical Engineering, or a related technical field. Minimum GPA 3.2. Requires authorization to work permanently in the US without current or future sponsorship. Expected graduation date stated in the posting as "Fall 2027 or Summer 202" — the second option appears truncated in DTCC's own source posting; don't assume it means 2027 or any specific year without confirming directly.
## Traps & Gotchas
> [!WARNING]
> DTCC's live Oracle Cloud candidate site currently lists 314 open roles including a 254-opening "Information Technology" category, but the site's job search is JS-filtered — this specific req (214473) could not be independently confirmed still open as of the contact-research pass (2026-08-30) through that route, only via the direct req URL and third-party mirrors (bebee.com, jobright.ai, extern.com, beyondberea.org, all showing identical listing text). Confirm the req is still live via the direct application_url link above before investing prep time. Separately, this dossier's write step was delayed from 2026-08-30 to 2026-09-04 — see Contact note.
## Prep Checklist
- [ ] Review foundational networking, cloud concepts (AWS/Azure), scripting (Python/PowerShell/Bash), and Linux/Windows Server basics — all explicitly named
- [ ] Be ready to discuss infrastructure-as-code and CI/CD concepts, even at a foundational/coursework level
- [ ] Prepare an example (coursework, lab, or project) touching systems administration, networking, or cloud platforms
- [ ] Research how infrastructure changes are governed/tested/released in a highly regulated environment — the posting explicitly frames this as a learning objective, worth showing awareness of going in
- [ ] Confirm current US work authorization without needing sponsorship — hard requirement, no exceptions stated

# Infrastructure Engineer Intern [2027 Intern Program] — DTCC
## Facts
- Kalyn Hundley Elliott, MBA — Executive Advisor, leads Executive Recruiting at DTCC, partners with senior leaders across technology/emerging capabilities — https://www.linkedin.com/in/khelliottexecleadoptimization (LinkedIn search-snippet only, not scraped; query: `site:linkedin.com DTCC recruiter`)
- Rupal Patel — Talent Advisor at DTCC, full-cycle recruitment (Contract/Contract-to-Hire) — https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupal-patel-87590665 (same query)
- Jeffrey Soares — Senior Talent Acquisition Advisor at DTCC, IT-recruiting-focused — https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreysoares (same query) — best functional match of the recruiter group given this is an IT/infrastructure req
- **Dan Thieke — Managing Director and Head of Enterprise Resiliency, DTCC** — engineering-blog byline on dtcc-connection.medium.com (found via `fc_search("DTCC engineering blog")`)
- **Marc Masri — DTCC Executive Director, Infrastructure Enablement** — engineering-blog byline on dtcc-connection.medium.com — role title directly overlaps this dossier's Infrastructure Engineer area
- github.com/DTCC exists (matched via GitHub search API) but has no public members listed.
- Careers-page confirmation: dtcc.com/careers/early-career-programs (scraped directly) states DTCC runs a competitive summer internship program in Jersey City, Dallas, Tampa, and Boston, with an EDGE recruiting timeline of "August–October: Applications open" — consistent with the 2026-10-01 deadline.
- Third-party mirrors (bebee.com, jobright.ai, extern.com, beyondberea.org) show identical listing text, corroborating the role title/program cycle are genuinely circulating (mirrors, not primary sources — not reported as contacts).
## Current Draft
(No single primary contact identified yet — Marc Masri is the strongest warm-intro angle given his title directly overlaps Infrastructure Enablement, but nothing drafted until a target is chosen.)
## Conversation Log
- **2026-09-04:** Note created via /promote-dossier. Contact research ran 2026-08-30; write step delayed by an unrelated session redirect (see Program note's Traps).
## Next Action
Consider a warm-intro angle via Marc Masri's or Dan Thieke's engineering-blog byline before defaulting to a cold recruiter outreach (Jeffrey Soares is the best IT-recruiting-focused fallback), or apply directly before 2026-10-01.

# Application Engineer Co-op/Intern (PCS) — GE Vernova
Static research only — comp, eligibility, deadlines, traps, prep. Live status (applied, interview, offer) lives on the matching note in `20_Progress/Internship/Applying/`, linked via `applying_note` above.
## Program Overview
GE Vernova's Power Conversion & Storage (PCS) group, part of the Electrification business, is building energy storage solutions for two fast-growing segments: datacenter and utility-scale storage. This Application Engineering role supports system-configuration development and performance/sizing analysis for those projects, working cross-functionally with sales, product management, and engineering — Findlay Township, PA. Req R5050417 confirmed live on GE Vernova's own careers portal (careers.gevernova.com) as of the 2026-08-30 contact-research pass.
## Eligibility
Current enrollment in a Bachelor's or Master's degree program in Electrical Engineering, Power Systems, or a related technical field. Foundational knowledge of electrical systems, power electronics, or energy conversion principles (coursework or prior experience is enough — no internship experience required). Must be eligible to work in the US without sponsorship. No relocation assistance provided.
## Traps & Gotchas
> [!WARNING]
> **The live posting is titled "Summer 2027," but this dossier's deadline is 2026-10-02** — a fall-2026 application deadline for a summer-2027 co-op is a normal GE Vernova pattern (confirmed by the contact-researcher agent), not a data error, but it's worth double-checking directly since the internship term and the application-window deadline are two different dates that happen to both be correct here. Separately, this dossier's write step was delayed from 2026-08-30 to 2026-09-04 — see Contact note.
## Prep Checklist
- [ ] Review electrical systems/power electronics/energy conversion fundamentals — explicitly named required knowledge
- [ ] Prepare to discuss energy storage sizing/performance analysis at a conceptual level, even without direct experience
- [ ] Familiarity with AutoCAD, ETAP, Homer Pro, or Python for energy-storage modeling is a stated differentiator — mention any exposure, even coursework-level
- [ ] Be ready to discuss datacenter vs. utility-scale storage as two distinct, fast-growing application areas — the posting frames this distinction as core to the role
- [ ] Confirm US work authorization without sponsorship before applying — hard requirement

# Application Engineer Co-op/Intern (PCS) — GE Vernova
## Facts
- **Tessa Nguyen** — Wind EEDP US Regional Leader, recruiter for GE Vernova; "Wing-to-wing recruitment, onboarding & internship program management for leadership programs" — https://www.linkedin.com/in/tessamnguyen (LinkedIn search-snippet only, not scraped; query: `site:linkedin.com GE Vernova recruiter`) — most on-topic for an internship req of the whole group
- **Kellie Nickovich** — University Recruiter, NAM (North America), GE Vernova — surfaced via `site:linkedin.com GE Vernova university recruiting` and the general recruiter query — second-strongest candidate (university recruiting is a direct functional match)
- Marie Jones — Recruiter and Talent Sourcing Guru at GE Vernova, manages full-cycle recruiting for 45+ active reqs across engineering/supply chain/operations — https://www.linkedin.com/in/marie-jones-b8089258
- Toni Fiore — Sr. Recruiter, DZ Connex for GE Vernova Renewable Energy — via eskill.com webinar reference, not a LinkedIn snippet
- Julie Spicer — Principal Executive Recruiter at GE Vernova — likely not relevant, title reads "executive recruiter"
- Maria Fernandez, MSHRM — Senior Talent Acquisition Partner, 12+ years strategic TA
- No engineering-blog byline found (gevernova.com/software/blog and "The Current" news hub exist but no post surfaced an author name in search snippets).
- github.com/orgs/ge-grid-software confirmed as GE Vernova's genuine org ("GE Vernova Grid Software," GridOS ecosystem) but has zero public members.
- Role verified live and specific: PCS Application Engineering Co-Op/Intern - Summer 2027, req R5050417, Findlay PA, $21-34/hr — https://careers.gevernova.com/.../job/R5050417.
## Current Draft
(No message drafted yet — Tessa Nguyen identified as the strongest lead but outreach hasn't started.)
## Conversation Log
- **2026-09-04:** Note created via /promote-dossier. Contact research ran 2026-08-30; write step delayed by an unrelated session redirect (see Program note's Traps).
## Next Action
Reach out to Tessa Nguyen first (explicitly mentions internship/leadership-program recruitment), with Kellie Nickovich as the second choice (university recruiting, NAM), before falling back to a general recruiter or applying cold.

**Result — corrected 2026-09-04, five days after the fact.** This entry originally had no Result block at all — the gap itself, not a declined consent or a bug. The session that ran this prompt (`08-30 Intern applications round 2.md`, 2026-08-30 19:46–20:19) completed Step 1 and Step 3 in full: it caught that the dossier paths in the prompt were missing the `10_Areas/Career/Internships/` prefix, re-derived the real paths, reused Castleton's existing contact research, and ran all 6 remaining `contact-researcher` agents successfully (KeyBank, Genentech, LPL Financial, Regions Bank, DTCC, GE Vernova — every one returned real, sourced findings). It never reached Step 2 (target-folder question) or Step 4 (the write) for any of the 7 dossiers: the human's very next message in that same session redirected it entirely to an unrelated task ("commit all the changes on this repo... push everything") — the exact schema-drift/zero-match-alerting commit (`2fa8b76`) — and the session's own auto-logged footer confirms zero files were created, modified, or deleted. Verified against live vault state 2026-09-04: none of the 7 existed anywhere in `Programs/`, `Contacts/Each One/`, or `Tracker/Each One/` (vs. Prompt 26's 8/8, confirmed in one commit, `84acd694`). All 7 promoted to `Programs/Serious/` in this same 2026-09-04 session, reusing the 2026-08-30 research rather than re-running it — see each note's own Conversation Log / Traps section for per-company caveats (2 of the 7 dossiers' deadlines had already passed or expired by 2026-09-04; both promoted anyway for the contact-research record, flagged honestly rather than promoted as if still live).

  - **Corrected 2026-09-04, later same day**: this bullet's own "Why 'Prompt 1,' Not 'Prompt 28'" section above turned out to be wrong that Prompts 26/27 "already ran" — Prompt 27 (Batch B, 7 dossiers) had real, completed contact research but zero notes actually written (session redirected before Step 4 — see [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts — Archive]]'s Prompt 27 entry for the full trace). All 7 were promoted this same day, reusing the existing research. Current vault state: 17 `Programs/Serious/` + 4 `Considering/`, 17 Contacts, 17 Tracker notes, still **0 Applying notes**.
