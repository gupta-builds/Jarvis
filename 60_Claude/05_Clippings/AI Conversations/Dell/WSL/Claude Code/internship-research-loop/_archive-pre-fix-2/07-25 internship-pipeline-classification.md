## You

You are working in gupta-builds/internship-research-loop (see Prompt 1 above for the pipeline's overall shape if you need it — this prompt is self-contained regardless). Current state, verified directly against the live repo before writing this: six sources feed the pipeline (SimplifyJobs, Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez, vanshb03, zshah101, Greenhouse, Ashby — see ingestion/sources.py, ingestion/normalize.py, core/filter.py). Three of the six (vanshb03, Greenhouse, Ashby) carry no structured `category` field on their Listing objects — Greenhouse and Ashby route through `_matches_free_text_source` in core/filter.py, matching on `listing.title` + `listing.raw_text` only. GREENHOUSE_COMPANIES and ASHBY_COMPANIES in ingestion/sources.py are hand-seeded token dicts — currently Greenhouse's seed list (fccincinnati, aquaticcapitalmanagement, walleyecapital-external-students, pdtpartners, virtu, mwinternshipprogram, optiverus) is entirely quant/prop-trading firms, and Ashby's (ellipsislabs, quadrillion-labs, circleback, ctgt, pylon-labs) is the only AI-adjacent seed set. This is real, decided design work from a planning session — implement it, do not re-derive or question the decisions below.

## Task A — CS/software-relevance gate (new hard rule, rejects at write time)
A listing must be genuinely Computer Science / software engineering at its core to be written as a dossier at all — this is a new required check alongside the existing OPT/US-location/degree checks, not a priority-tier distinction. Adjacent fields (hardware, robotics, astrophysics, space, embedded/firmware) are not automatically excluded — they pass this gate only if the specific posting's actual content shows real software/CS relevance the candidate is suited for, per the persona in Prompt 1 (reference Main Resume.md's skills/bullets and Engineer Edge Roadmap.md's stated direction — both live in the Jarvis vault at 20_Progress/Internship/Resumes/Main Resume.md and 10_Areas/Career/Engineer Edge Roadmap.md respectively; read them for the real bar before writing keyword rules, don't guess at what counts as "suitable"). Non-software roles (financial/risk analyst, tax, sports performance analytics, pure hardware-manufacturing roles with no software component) fail this gate outright and must not be written anywhere, including the Other bucket in Task B. Implement as a new deterministic function in core/filter.py (or a new core/priority.py module if that's architecturally cleaner — your call, but keep it consistent with this file's existing zero-LLM, keyword/heuristic style), called after the existing matches() checks pass, before the write gate. Add fixture-based tests using real dossier content already in the vault as source material (see Task D for where actual current dossiers live) — do not write synthetic test data if a real example already demonstrates the case.

## Task B — Priority classification (deterministic, runs only on listings that passed Task A)
Classify into exactly one bucket, based on title + category (where present) + fetched posting content:
- AI/ML — LLM, RAG, agents, ML infrastructure, applied AI, deep learning signals
- Fullstack — product/frontend/backend/systems engineering signals
- CyS & Finance — security or finance-adjacent software engineering signals
- Other — genuine software engineering (already confirmed real by Task A) that matches none of the above three

Each classified dossier gets a short callout stating which real signal(s) from the posting drove the classification — do not include a numeric label like "Priority 1/2/3" anywhere in the visible note; the folder location alone encodes the category, a number in the callout text is redundant and was explicitly rejected in design review.

## Task C — Route into vault subfolders
Write each classified dossier into the matching existing subfolder under 10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers/ in the Jarvis vault: "1 - AI & ML/", "2 - Fullstack/", "3 - CyS & Finance/", or "Other/" (exact names, spaces and all — verify by listing the actual folder before writing). These folders exist and are currently empty. Do not write into or otherwise touch the "Viewed/" sibling folder — that folder's role is separate from this pipeline (a human triage bin, not a write target for this codebase).

## Task D — Dossier template and identity fixes (vault_writer/writer.py, vault_writer/templates/dossier.md.j2, core/identity.py)
Verified directly against a real hand-edited example the candidate wrote (10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers/Software Engineer - Ellipsis Labs.md in the Jarvis vault — read it directly for the exact target shape before implementing):
1. Convert `date_posted` from a raw Unix epoch integer to a real ISO date string at write time.
2. Drop `uid` and `category` from the rendered frontmatter entirely. Keep the raw uid available internally for dedup against state/seen_ids.json without exposing it in the note body or frontmatter.
3. Replace the `promoted:` frontmatter field with `next:` (empty by default), matching every other note type's convention across the Jarvis vault.
4. Change the filename convention to "[Role] - [Company].md". Sanitize filesystem-illegal characters (slashes, colons, quotes — company names with parenthetical aliases like `Fussball Club Cincinnati LLC ("FC Cincinnati")` need real handling, don't just crash or silently truncate). Add a collision tie-breaker for same-role-same-company duplicates (append a short disambiguating suffix rather than overwriting or erroring).
5. Change the header to `# {{ title }}` only — drop the current template's `# {{ company }} — {{ title }}` (company is already in the filename and frontmatter, the current header is redundant).
6. Rewrite the auto-generated intro sentence ("Auto-discovered {{date}} from {{source}}. Posting content below fetched at discovery...") to state something with real information plainly, without templated filler — this vault has a standing rule against generic AI-sounding boilerplate prose (see HUMAN_WRITING.md if you want the actual standard) and the current phrasing was flagged against it directly.
7. Real bug, not a template gap: the Ellipsis Labs example shows an Ashby-sourced posting where the actual job-description prose never made it into the fetched content — only the Qualifications section came through, leaving the Description section genuinely empty. Investigate ingestion/posting_page.py's handling of Ashby-hosted pages specifically (JS-rendered content may need an explicit wait condition on the fetch) and fix the underlying extraction, not by adding a fallback placeholder.

## Task E — Contact-research widening (enrich.py, Layer 5 — stays promotion-triggered only, never called automatically from run_pipeline.py, unchanged)
Add a scoped Firecrawl search step (search, not scrape) per company: queries for "[company] recruiter" and "[company] university recruiting", in addition to the existing GitHub-org-member and engineering-blog-byline discovery already in enrich.py. Explicitly exclude these domains from counting as a valid hit even if returned: Indeed, Glassdoor, SimplifyJobs, and any linkedin.com/jobs/ URL. Separately, add a narrowly-scoped LinkedIn search-snippet lookup: a Firecrawl search (never a fetch or scrape of the actual linkedin.com URL) for site:linkedin.com plus the company name and a recruiting-related term, surfacing only whatever text the search result snippet itself contains (typically a name and title). Do not fetch, scrape, or otherwise load the underlying LinkedIn page at any point in this flow — that would cross this pipeline's standing rule against login-wall automation, which stays in force unchanged. State this ceiling in a code comment so a future session doesn't try to extend past it.

## Task F (optional, flag as optional in your summary, do only if time allows after A-E are done and tested) — Seed list diversification
ASHBY_COMPANIES and GREENHOUSE_COMPANIES in ingestion/sources.py are hand-seeded and currently skew heavily toward quant/prop-trading (7 of 12 total seeded companies). Research and add a handful of real, verified-live Ashby or Greenhouse boards for companies actually doing AI/ML or applied AI work, using the same verification standard already documented in the existing comment above GREENHOUSE_COMPANIES (never add a token that hasn't been confirmed live against real job data — a wrong guess silently returns zero jobs, not an error).

## Verification, all tasks
Run the full test suite and report the exact pass count before declaring anything done. Report every task's outcome individually (A through E, plus F if attempted) rather than one combined summary — if something was skipped or only partially done, say so plainly rather than folding it into an "overall done" statement.

## Claude

I'll start by loading the jarvis-fs read tools (for vault files) and launching Explore agents to understand the codebase — these can run in parallel.

While those two agents explore the codebase, I'll read the vault files directly since they inform the persona/style bar for Tasks A and D.

jarvis-fs is scoped to this repo only. The vault tools are under a different MCP server — let me find them.

The vault's own MCP server isn't connected this session — but the Read tool can access any path on the machine. Let me locate the vault directory on disk.

Both codebase explorations are back. Let me check if the vault location was found by the background search.

Found it — there's a `jarvis-checkout/` directory inside the repo itself (the pipeline's git checkout of the vault). Let me explore that.

D: is mounted — let me find the actual vault path since `/Users/Anant/` isn't right for a Windows drive.

Found it. Let's confirm and dig into the relevant subpaths.

All the key files exist. Let me read them directly.

Good — this gives me a clear picture, including the fact that the "Priority 2: [Reason]" callout format in the example is the *rejected* old format (Task B explicitly forbids numeric labels). Let me check a few more things: the profile config, validate.py, and the current state of the target vault folders.

I have enough detail now to see two real architectural conflicts the task description doesn't resolve. Let me check with you before planning around them.

Both confirmed. Now I'll hand this off to a Plan agent with the full research context to produce a detailed implementation design.

While that agent works, let me read a few more things that will help finalize the plan — the two test files it flagged, and a couple real dossier examples that could serve as Task A fixtures.

Good real fixtures for the "adjacent field but genuinely software" pass case. Let me check if there are any real reject-worthy examples (finance/analyst/non-software) already sitting in the vault, useful as Task A test fixtures.

These map directly to the reject categories named in the task ("sports performance analytics," "tax," "pure hardware"). Let me confirm their actual content.

I now have five concrete real fixtures spanning reject/pass/adjacent cases for Task A. Let me check on the Plan agent.

My plan is a two-stage gate: (1) a cheap title/raw_text-only reject runs before the write gate, catching the obvious non-software cases (financial analyst, tax, sports analytics) for free; (2) the adjacent-field content check + Task B's classification both run later, at the same point the existing OPT-eligibility check already uses the fetched posting content, right before the final write.

- `Agent` — `{"description":"Design implementation plan for pipeline tasks A-F","subagent_type":"Plan","prompt":"You are designing an implementation plan for a Python job-listing pipeline repo at /home/anant_gupta/projects/work/internship-research-loop. Do NOT re-explore the codebase from scratch — I've already done deep research and am giving you everything you need below. Your job is to turn this into a precise, file-by-file implementation plan. Do not write any code or edit any files — this is planning only, output your plan as your final response text.\n\n# The six tasks (from the user's design-review prompt, already decided — implement, don't re-derive)\n\n## Task A — CS/software-relevance gate (new hard rule, rejects at write time)\nA listing must be genuinely CS/software-engineering at its core to be written as a dossier at all. Adjacent fields (hardware, robotics, astrophysics, space, embedded/firmware) are NOT auto-excluded — they pass only if the specific posting's actual content shows real software/CS relevance the candidate is suited for. Non-software roles (financial/risk analyst, tax, sports performance analytics, pure hardware-manufacturing with no software component) fail outright and must not be written anywhere, including the Other bucket. Zero-LLM, deterministic, keyword/heuristic style matching the rest of core/filter.py. Called after matches() passes, before the write gate. Needs fixture-based tests using REAL dossier content already in the vault (see dossier examples below) — not synthetic data where a real example demonstrates the case.\n\nCONFIRMED DESIGN (user approved): two-stage gate.\n- Stage 1 (cheap, before the write gate in validate_and_write): title/raw_text-only reject of obviously non-software roles (financial analyst, tax, sports performance analytics, etc.) — same info matches()/`_matches_free_text_source` already has, no fetch needed.\n- Stage 2 (content-based, at the SAME point the existing OPT-eligibility check runs, i.e. after fetch_page_fn returns page_md but before the final write_dossier() call in validate_and_write): confirms/rejects adjacent-field postings (hardware/robotics/astrophysics/space/embedded/firmware) using the actual fetched posting_content. If fetch fails (page_md empty, fail-open case), the existing pipeline philosophy is permissive/fail-open everywhere (matches() docstrings repeatedly say \"false-negative-is-worse-than-false-positive\") — so if stage-1 didn't reject it and content fetch fails, let it through rather than blocking indefinitely. State this reasoning explicitly in the plan.\n\nThe persona/bar for what counts as \"suited for CS/software\" comes from these two real vault files (I already read them in full, contents below) — Main Resume.md and Engineer Edge Roadmap.md. Use them to write real keyword/signal lists, not guesses.\n\n**Main Resume.md skills relevant to matching:**\n- Programming: Python, Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Java, C\n- AI & Data: Generative AI, LLM APIs, RAG, embeddings, pgvector, dataset curation, data pipelines\n- Full Stack/Web: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, REST APIs, server actions, backend logic, responsive UI\n- Infrastructure: Postgres, Supabase, Neon, Drizzle ORM, Strapi, Docker, Linux, Git, Vercel\n- Experience: Rust-based logging middleware for astronomical alert brokering (BOOM/UMN research), API design for structured data ingestion, Next.js/React web dev intern, AI ops dashboards, fintech forecasting tools\n- Major: BS Computer Science, University of Minnesota, expected Spring 2028\n\n**Engineer Edge Roadmap.md positioning:** \"systems-minded AI engineer\" — full-stack products + backend systems + observability + AI workflows + clear communication. Four arenas: System Design (APIs, schemas, queues, caching, auth, observability, reliability), Debugging/Reliability, AI Engineering (RAG, embeddings, retrieval, LLM evaluation), Proof/Communication. This confirms: AI/ML work, full-stack web work, backend/systems work, and security-adjacent software work are all clearly \"suited for,\" while something like \"pure hardware bring-up with zero software component\" or \"financial analyst\" is not.\n\nSo: a listing whose actual content shows software engineering work (writing code, building systems, APIs, ML, data pipelines, testing, debugging, full-stack, etc.) passes even if the company is in an adjacent industry (space, robotics, astrophysics) or has hardware in its name — the litmus test is whether the posting's real duties involve software/CS work a CS major with this skillset would do. A listing that is fundamentally non-technical (financial analyst, tax preparer, sports analytics without an engineering component) fails regardless of company.\n\n## Task B — Priority classification (deterministic, runs only on listings that passed Task A)\nClassify into exactly one bucket based on title + category (where present) + fetched posting content:\n- AI/ML — LLM, RAG, agents, ML infrastructure, applied AI, deep learning signals\n- Fullstack — product/frontend/backend/systems engineering signals\n- CyS & Finance — security or finance-adjacent software engineering signals\n- Other — genuine software engineering (already confirmed real by Task A) matching none of the above three\n\nEach classified dossier gets a short callout stating which real signal(s) from the posting drove the classification — NO numeric label (\"Priority 1/2/3\") anywhere in the visible note; this was explicitly rejected in design review. The folder location alone encodes the category.\n\nPer the confirmed two-stage design, Task B's classification runs at the same point as Task A's stage-2 content check (after fetch, before final write) since it also needs fetched posting content per the task description.\n\n## Task C — Route into vault subfolders\nWrite each classified dossier into the matching EXISTING subfolder under `10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers/` in the vault at `/mnt/d/Users/_Anant/10_Areas/Documents/Jarvis` (this is the real absolute vault path on this machine — the pipeline normally clones this vault's git repo into a scratch `jarvis-checkout/` dir at runtime via jarvis_dir param, but I confirmed the real vault directly at this absolute path for research purposes): \"1 - AI & ML/\", \"2 - Fullstack/\", \"3 - CyS & Finance/\", \"Other/\" — verified these exact folder names exist and are currently EMPTY (I ls'd them directly: 1 - AI & ML, 2 - Fullstack, 3 - CyS & Finance, Other, Viewed all exist under Dossiers/, all empty except Dossiers/ root itself which has ~50 existing flat-named dossier files like `greenhouse-8077685.md`, `simplifyjobs-*.md`, `vanshb03-*.md`, `zshah101-*.md`, and one hand-renamed `Software Engineer - Ellipsis Labs.md`). Do NOT write into or touch \"Viewed/\" (human triage bin, separate role). Do NOT migrate/move the existing flat-root dossiers — this is forward-only routing for new writes; leave old files alone.\n\n## Task D — Dossier template and identity fixes\nFiles: `vault_writer/writer.py`, `vault_writer/templates/dossier.md.j2`, `core/identity.py`, ALSO (not in the original task list but required — I found this via code reading) `vault_writer/validate.py` needs updating because `REQUIRED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` in validate.py currently hardcodes `(\"uid\", \"company\", \"title\", \"url\", \"source\", \"category\", \"terms\", \"locations\", \"target_year\", \"date_posted\", \"date_found\", \"matched_reason\", \"status\", \"promoted\", \"tags\")` and `check_format_compliance()` REJECTS any dossier markdown missing any of those fields — so dropping uid/category and renaming promoted→next will make every future write fail validation unless this tuple is updated too.\n\n1. Convert `date_posted` from raw Unix epoch int to ISO date string at write time (in `build_frontmatter()`, writer.py line ~53, currently `\"date_posted\": listing.date_posted` passed straight through unmodified).\n2. Drop `uid` and `category` from rendered frontmatter (writer.py `build_frontmatter()` lines ~44 and ~49) entirely.\n   CONFIRMED DESIGN: uid must still exist internally for dedup (`state/seen_ids.json`, already handled — no frontmatter needed there since that's driven by run_pipeline.py's own in-memory uid) AND for `recheck.py`'s removal-checking, which currently does `source, _, raw_id = fm[\"uid\"].partition(\":\")` after `scan_dossiers()` scans frontmatter (recheck.py line ~63). Since frontmatter will no longer carry uid, add a local JSON manifest file in this repo's `state/` dir (e.g. `state/dossier_uids.json`, sibling to the existing `state/seen_ids.json`) mapping vault-relative-filepath → uid, written by `write_dossier()` (or a new function called alongside it) every time a dossier is written, and read by recheck.py instead of `fm[\"uid\"]`. This never touches the vault note itself. Plan exactly how write_dossier's signature changes, where this manifest lives, how it's loaded/saved (mirror `load_seen_ids`/`save_seen_ids` patterns already in run_pipeline.py), and how recheck.py's removal-check function needs to change to consult it instead of frontmatter.\n3. Replace `promoted:` frontmatter field with `next:` (empty by default) — matches every other vault note-type convention (confirmed directly: Main Resume.md has `next: \"...\"`, Engineer Edge Roadmap.md has `next: \"[[Arc (Learning Tracker)]]\"`, and the candidate's own hand-edited Ellipsis Labs dossier already uses `next:` with no value).\n4. Filename convention → \"[Role] - [Company].md\" (confirmed exact real example: \"Software Engineer - Ellipsis Labs.md\"). Sanitize filesystem-illegal chars (slashes, colons, quotes — e.g. `Fussball Club Cincinnati LLC (\"FC Cincinnati\")` must not crash or silently truncate). Add a collision tie-breaker for same-role-same-company duplicates (e.g. append \" (2)\", \" (3)\" etc. rather than overwrite/error — plan currently has no such collision handling at all, `write_dossier` just does `path.write_text(markdown)` unconditionally). This replaces the current `slugify_uid()`-based naming (`{source}-{raw_id}.md`) entirely — but `slugify_uid` is still used by tests (`test_slugify_uid_is_filesystem_safe` in tests/test_writer.py) and matched against in multiple tests, so plan how those tests need to change too, and check for other callers of `slugify_uid` before deciding whether to keep, rename, or delete it.\n5. Header → `# {{ title }}` only, drop `# {{ company }} — {{ title }}` (company already in filename+frontmatter).\n6. Rewrite the intro sentence — current template (dossier.md.j2, two variants) says \"Auto-discovered {{ date_found }} from {{ source }}. Posting content below fetched at discovery (verbatim extraction, trimmed); company/contact enrichment happens on promotion, per [[30_Order/Workflows/Internship Pipeline]].\" / the no-content variant \"...No enrichment yet — company/contact research happens on promotion...\". The vault's HUMAN_WRITING.md (I read it in full) bans generic AI-sounding filler — \"Delete any sentence that could be pasted unchanged into a random productivity blog... If a sentence survives only because it sounds polished, remove it. If it survives because it carries a mechanism, example, contrast, or decision, keep it.\" Also bans words like \"seamless\", \"comprehensive\", \"leverage\", etc. (not directly present here but the spirit applies — no templated throat-clearing). Design a replacement intro that states real facts plainly: e.g. something like \"Found {{ date_found }} via {{ source }}.\" or similar minimal factual statement — plan the exact replacement text for both the with-content and without-content template branches, keeping it short and information-dense, no meta-commentary about the pipeline's own workflow process (the current text explains internal pipeline mechanics like \"enrichment happens on promotion\" which is arguably also unnecessary meta-filler — decide whether to keep a pointer to the Internship Pipeline workflow note or drop it, lean toward dropping pipeline-mechanics narration and just stating the fact).\n7. Real bug: on the Ellipsis Labs example (Ashby-hosted URL `jobs.ashbyhq.com/ellipsislabs/...`), the fetched posting content includes the company blurb and \"you will:\" bullets and the full Qualifications section, but the \"### Description\" section (what the internship is actually about) came through completely empty — the candidate left a bracketed note \"[What the internship is about - scrape the text written on the internship for this]\" showing it's a known gap. I already read `ingestion/posting_page.py` in full: `fetch_posting_markdown()` calls Firecrawl's `/v1/scrape` with `{\"url\": url, \"formats\": [\"markdown\"], \"waitFor\": 8000}` (8s wait for JS render — comment says \"ATS pages are SPAs\"), and `extract_content()` does line-by-line filtering starting at the first heading `s.startswith(\"#\") and len(s) > 4`, cutting at `_CUT_MARKERS` (apply-form/EEO chrome) and dropping `_NOISE` lines (nav/form junk). There is NO Ashby-specific branching anywhere in this file today. Root cause is not yet confirmed (needs live investigation during implementation, not derivable from static reading alone) — plan should describe the investigation approach: fetch the raw Firecrawl markdown for a live Ashby-hosted URL (e.g. re-fetch the Ellipsis Labs URL or another Ashby-seeded company from ASHBY_COMPANIES) and inspect whether (a) the Description section's content is present in the raw markdown but getting cut by `_CUT_MARKERS`/`_NOISE`, (b) it's genuinely absent from the raw markdown because Ashby lazy-loads/collapses that section behind an interaction Firecrawl's `waitFor` alone doesn't trigger (in which case the fix is likely bumping `waitFor` or adding an `actions` array to the Firecrawl scrape payload, e.g. a wait/scroll action, possibly gated on `\"ashbyhq.com\" in url` so other ATSs aren't affected), or (c) the heading-detection start condition itself skips into the wrong section. Plan should NOT commit to a specific code fix yet — the task explicitly says \"fix the underlying extraction, not by adding a fallback placeholder,\" so the plan should describe writing a small standalone diagnostic script (using the real FIRECRAWL_API_KEY, live network call) as step 1 of implementing this subtask, reading the raw output, and only then deciding the actual code change based on what's observed. Note the existing fixture `tests/fixtures/posting_fiverings.md` (a real Greenhouse-sourced fetched page, used by `test_extract_content_from_real_page` in tests/test_posting_page.py) as the pattern to follow — plan should add an equivalent new fixture file with real fetched Ashby markdown (e.g. `tests/fixtures/posting_ashby_<company>.md`) once the live investigation captures it, and a new test asserting the Description section is no longer empty.\n\n## Task E — Contact-research widening (enrich.py, Layer 5, promotion-triggered only, unchanged trigger — never called from run_pipeline.py)\nI already read `enrich.py` in full. Existing pattern to reuse: `_fc(path, payload, key)` POSTs to `https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/{path}` with Bearer auth; `fc_search(query, key)` hits `/search` with `{\"query\":..., \"limit\":5}` returning `.get(\"data\", [])` (a list of hit dicts, each with at least a `\"url\"` key — the existing blog-discovery code only reads `hit[\"url\"]`, doesn't currently use title/description fields, so the plan needs to note that Firecrawl's real `/search` response shape likely includes `title`/`description` snippet fields per hit — standard search-API shape — and the plan should specify reading those for the LinkedIn snippet feature specifically, without fetching/scraping the LinkedIn URL itself).\n\nAdd:\n1. Two new scoped Firecrawl SEARCH queries per company (search only, never scrape): `f\"{company} recruiter\"` and `f\"{company} university recruiting\"`, following the exact same `fc_search` pattern as the existing `f\"{company} engineering blog\"` call at enrich.py line ~133. Explicitly exclude hits from these domains even if returned: indeed.com, glassdoor.com, simplify.jobs (or whatever SimplifyJobs' actual domain is — check), and any `linkedin.com/jobs/` URL. Plan the exact filter function (e.g. `_EXCLUDED_DOMAINS` regex/set checked against `hit[\"url\"]`) and where results get merged into the existing `contacts`/`sources` lists alongside the blog-byline and GitHub-org-member results, and how the Enrichment section's markdown table (built at enrich.py lines ~147-164) should represent these new contact sources (source label like \"recruiter search\" / \"university recruiting search\").\n2. A separate narrowly-scoped LinkedIn search-SNIPPET lookup: one `fc_search` call for a query like `f\"site:linkedin.com {company} recruiter\"` (or \"university recruiting\" — pick one recruiting-related term), surfacing ONLY whatever text the search result snippet itself contains (typically a name + title, from the hit's title/description fields) — explicitly NEVER call `fc_scrape` or otherwise fetch/load the actual linkedin.com URL at any point. This is a hard, standing rule already established elsewhere in the codebase (enrich.py's own module docstring already states \"Hard line per the plan: no LinkedIn, no CAPTCHA bypass... no login walls. Anything behind one gets skipped.\" — so this is loosening that ONLY for search-snippet text, not for any fetch). Plan should specify adding a code comment stating this ceiling explicitly (task says: \"State this ceiling in a code comment so a future session doesn't try to extend past it\") — e.g. right above the new function, something like `# Search-snippet text only — NEVER fc_scrape() or otherwise fetch the underlying linkedin.com URL; that crosses the login-wall rule above.`\n\n## Task F (optional — flag as optional, do only if time allows after A-E)\n`GREENHOUSE_COMPANIES` and `ASHBY_COMPANIES` in `ingestion/sources.py` currently: Greenhouse = {fccincinnati, aquaticcapitalmanagement, walleyecapital-external-students, pdtpartners, virtu, mwinternshipprogram, optiverus} (7, all quant/prop-trading), Ashby = {ellipsislabs, quadrillion-labs, circleback, ctgt, pylon-labs} (5, the only AI-adjacent seed set). Need to research and add a handful of real, VERIFIED-LIVE Ashby or Greenhouse boards for AI/ML or applied-AI companies, following the exact verification standard already documented in the comment above `GREENHOUSE_COMPANIES` in sources.py (paraphrased: \"every token verified live this session to resolve with real job data... never add a token that hasn't been confirmed live, a wrong guess silently returns 0 jobs, not an error\"). Plan should note this requires live HTTP verification during implementation (hitting the real Greenhouse/Ashby public job-board APIs for candidate company tokens), not something plannable statically — list this as an implementation-time research step, not a fixed list of companies to add (I have not verified any candidates live, so the plan must not hardcode guessed company tokens).\n\n# Existing code patterns confirmed by direct reading (reuse these, don't reinvent)\n\n**core/filter.py** (254 lines): `matches(listing, profile)` at line 67 is the main dispatch — checks `listing.active is not False` → per-source `_matches_*` dispatch (line 70-87, dict/if-elif by `listing.source`) → `location_eligible()` if `profile[\"locations_allow\"]==\"us_remote\"` → `degrees_eligible()`. `_matches_free_text_source(listing, profile)` at line 215 is shared by Greenhouse/Ashby/Freehire/AIJobs (aliased at lines 230-236) — builds `haystack = f\"{listing.title} {listing.raw_text}\"`, checks exclude_terms reject, wanted-terms accept, bare-target-year fallback accept. `_norm(s)` (line 14) lowercases+collapses whitespace — reuse for any new keyword matching. `core/profile.yaml` holds the `terms`/`exclude_terms`/`categories`/`locations_allow`/`degrees_allow` config loaded via `load_profile()`.\n\n**ingestion/normalize.py** `Listing` dataclass (lines 8-23): fields `company, title, url, source, category=\"\", terms=[], locations=[], target_year=[], degrees=[], active=None, date_posted=None, raw_id=None, sponsorship=\"\", raw_text=\"\"`. `category` defaults to `\"\"` not None. `raw_text` only populated for Greenhouse/Ashby/Freehire (structured sources leave it empty).\n\n**run_pipeline.py** (337 lines) orchestration order in `run_once()` (line 203): `check_schema_drift` → `load_seen_ids` → `fetch_and_filter` (calls `matches()` per listing, line 107-115) → `dedup_new` → `_prioritize_and_cap` (sorts by date_posted desc, caps at `MAX_NEW_WRITES_PER_RUN=18`, line 67) → `validate_and_write` (line 132, the write gate + OPT-check + write, detailed below) → weekly rollup → `push_fn` → mark seen_ids only after confirmed push → save_seen_ids/append_run_log → GH issue on systemic rejection. `build_matched_reason(listing, profile)` (line 98) only special-cases SimplifyJobs/JGCL text, falls through to `\"matched\"` for everything else.\n\n`validate_and_write()` (line 132-195) is THE key integration point for Tasks A/B/C:\n```python\ndef validate_and_write(new_listings, profile, jarvis_dir, seen_ids, date_found,\n                       http_head=None, fetch_page_fn=None, opt_cache=None):\n    dossier_keys = {cross_source_key(fm.get(\"company\",\"\"), fm.get(\"title\",\"\")) for fm in scan_dossiers(jarvis_dir)}\n    written_uids, rejections = [], []\n    for uid, listing in new_listings:\n        cached = opt_cache.get(uid)\n        if cached and cached.get(\"verdict\") == \"excluded\":\n            rejections.append(...); continue\n        markdown = render_dossier(listing, uid, date_found, build_matched_reason(listing, profile))\n        result = validate(listing, uid, markdown, seen_ids, http_head=http_head, dossier_keys=dossier_keys)\n        if not result.passed:\n            rejections.append(...); continue\n        posting_content = \"\"\n        if fetch_page_fn is not None:\n            try:\n                page_md = fetch_page_fn(listing.url)\n            except Exception:\n                page_md = \"\"\n            if page_md:\n                signal = opt_exclusion(page_md)\n                if signal:\n                    opt_cache[uid] = {...}; rejections.append(...); continue\n                opt_cache[uid] = {\"verdict\": \"eligible\", ...}\n                posting_content = extract_content(page_md)\n                enriched = render_dossier(listing, uid, date_found, build_matched_reason(listing, profile), posting_content)\n                if check_format_compliance(enriched).passed:\n                    markdown = enriched\n        write_dossier(jarvis_dir, uid, markdown)\n        written_uids.append(uid)\n        dossier_keys.add(cross_source_key(listing.company, listing.title))\n    return written_uids, rejections\n```\nTask A stage-1 (title/raw_text reject) belongs right after `matches()` in `fetch_and_filter` OR as the very first check inside this loop before `render_dossier` — plan should pick the cleanest seam (I lean toward inside `fetch_and_filter`, alongside the existing `matches(l, profile)` call at line ~112, since the task literally says \"called after the existing matches() checks pass, before the write gate\" and fetch_and_filter is squarely \"after matches(), before validate_and_write's write gate\" — but note fetch_and_filter iterates ALL fetched listings including ones that'll later be deduped/capped, so running Stage 1 there is fine since it's cheap and title-only, no network cost). Task A stage-2 (content-based) + Task B (classification) + Task C (routing) all belong inside this loop, in the `if page_md:` block, after `posting_content = extract_content(page_md)` and before `write_dossier(...)` — Task A stage-2 can reject (skip write, add to rejections) same as the OPT check does; Task B's classify() result feeds Task C's routing which needs to change `write_dossier`'s signature to accept a target subfolder name (or classification bucket → the function computes the folder name mapping internally). Also must handle the case `fetch_page_fn is None` or `page_md` empty (fail-open case, e.g. some run_pipeline callers/tests don't pass fetch_page_fn) — per the confirmed design, stage-2 fails open (writes to... which folder then? Plan needs to decide: probably still needs SOME classification even without content, falling back to title+category-only signals, landing in Other if nothing else matches — since Task C requires every written dossier to go into one of the 4 folders, there's no \"unclassified\" bucket available). State this explicitly as a design decision: when content is unavailable, Task A stage-2 fails open topic-wise, and Task B classification runs on title+category alone (weaker signal, same function, content param just empty), which is a legitimate degraded-signal case already handled by keyword lists (empty content string simply produces zero content-based hits, title/category hits still register).\n\n**vault_writer/writer.py** (106 lines) — `DOSSIER_SUBPATH = Path(\"10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers\")` (module-level, line ~16), `build_frontmatter()` (line 41-59) builds the field dict in order (uid, company, title, url, source, category, terms, locations, target_year, date_posted, date_found, matched_reason, status, promoted, tags), `_yaml_list()` helper coerces None/empty to `[]`, custom `_FrontmatterDumper(yaml.SafeDumper)` renders None as blank not `null`. `render_dossier()` (line 62-75) builds frontmatter_yaml string then calls `_template.render(frontmatter_yaml=..., company=, title=, date_found=, source=, posting_content=)` — template only gets those 5 vars, nothing else (category/uid/etc. only exist inside the pre-rendered YAML string). `slugify_uid(uid)` (line 78-80) does `re.sub(r\"[^a-zA-Z0-9]+\", \"-\", uid).strip(\"-\").lower()`. `write_dossier(vault_root, uid, markdown)` (line 99-106): `dossiers_dir = Path(vault_root)/DOSSIER_SUBPATH`, `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`, `path = dossiers_dir / f\"{slugify_uid(uid)}.md\"`, `path.write_text(markdown)`. `scan_dossiers(vault_root)` (line 83-96) globs `*.md` in that single flat dir, regex-extracts+YAML-parses frontmatter block, keeps entries with truthy `uid`, stashes `Path` at `fm[\"_path\"]`.\n\n**vault_writer/templates/dossier.md.j2** (8 lines) — exact current content:\n```\n---\n{{ frontmatter_yaml }}---\n# {{ company }} — {{ title }}\n{% if posting_content %}Auto-discovered {{ date_found }} from {{ source }}.

BUT the \"Auto-discovered... - [Improve content written over here]\" line and the \"> [!NOTE] Priority 2: [Reason]\" callout are the candidate's OWN bracketed self-notes flagging what's WRONG/TODO — the \"Priority 2\" numeric callout is explicitly the REJECTED old format per Task B's spec (\"do not include a numeric label like 'Priority 1/2/3'\"), so the new callout format must NOT look like this — it should read something like `> [!NOTE] AI/ML: <real signal from the posting>` or similar, using the bucket name instead of a number, per Task B. `date_posted: 1774563646` is STILL a raw epoch int in this example — confirms Task D.1's bug is real and unfixed, not something to preserve.

Task C's subfolder routing will need this fixture updated (or write_dossier's `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` already creates subfolders on demand, so maybe no fixture change needed — plan should decide and state which).\n- tests/test_posting_page.py (80 lines, full file already quoted above) — real-fixture pattern via `tests/fixtures/posting_fiverings.md` (a real captured Greenhouse markdown page) for `test_extract_content_from_real_page`. Task D.7's new test should follow this exact pattern with a new `tests/fixtures/posting_ashby_<company>.md` fixture captured live during implementation.\n- tests/test_validate.py (198 lines, not yet read in full by me — plan should note it needs reading first thing during implementation since REQUIRED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS changes will likely break existing tests there that assert on the old field set).\n- tests/test_sources.py (181 lines) — asserts against `len(sources.GREENHOUSE_COMPANIES)`/`len(sources.ASHBY_COMPANIES)` dynamically (not hardcoded counts), so Task F's dict additions won't break these tests.\n- tests/test_identity.py (54 lines, not yet read — plan should note reading it before touching core/identity.py, though Task D doesn't actually require changing compute_uid/cross_source_key logic itself, just how the frontmatter renderer uses/hides it).\n\n# Your job\nProduce a detailed, file-by-file implementation plan covering Tasks A through F (F marked optional/best-effort).

## Claude

I'm waiting on the background Plan agent to finish designing the implementation approach for Tasks A–F. I've completed all the research needed: read every relevant source file in the pipeline (`core/filter.py`, `ingestion/sources.py`, `ingestion/normalize.py`, `vault_writer/writer.py`, `vault_writer/validate.py`, `core/identity.py`, `enrich.py`, `ingestion/posting_page.py`, `run_pipeline.py`, `recheck.py`, and the relevant test files), plus the vault files that set the bar for Task A/D (`Main Resume.md`, `Engineer Edge Roadmap.md`, `HUMAN_WRITING.md`, and the hand-edited Ellipsis Labs dossier example), and pulled five real dossiers from the vault to use as concrete test fixtures — including exact matches for the "sports performance analytics," "tax," and "pure hardware" reject/pass cases the task description names.

I also caught two real architectural gaps the task list didn't mention and confirmed how to handle them with you: `recheck.py` depends on `uid` living in dossier frontmatter (which Task D wants removed) — resolved via a local `state/dossier_uids.json` manifest; and the timing conflict between Task A/B needing fetched posting content and the pipeline only fetching that content after the write gate — resolved via a two-stage gate.

Once the Plan agent returns, I'll fold its structural plan together with the real fixture research into the final plan file for your review.

That was just the background wait timer completing, not the Plan agent — still waiting on its actual design output. No action needed yet.

Check whether the Plan agent (design implementation plan for pipeline tasks A-F) has finished; if so synthesize the final plan file, otherwise continue waiting.

## Claude

Still running — it just confirmed the baseline test suite (227 passing) and is now writing the full plan. I'll wait for its completion notification rather than poll further.

Waiting on the Plan agent to finish composing the plan — will resume once it completes or the fallback wakeup fires.

**Tool calls:**

- `ToolSearch` — `{"query":"select:TaskList,TaskGet,TaskOutput","max_results":5}`
- `TaskOutput` — `{"task_id":"a84025365690206ae","block":false,"timeout":5000}`
- `ScheduleWakeup` — `{"delaySeconds":300,"reason":"Plan agent confirmed baseline (227 tests passing) and is now composing the plan text; check back if no notification arrives first.","prompt":"Check whether the Plan agent (design implementation plan for pipeline tasks A-F) has finished; if so synthesize the final plan file, otherwise continue waiting."}`

# Implementation Plan — Tasks A–F

Verification command throughout: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v` (baseline: 227 passed). Run the full suite after each task, not just new tests — several tasks touch shared render/validate paths.

## Task D first (foundation), then A, then B, then C, then E, then F

Reordering rationale: A/B/C all plug into `validate_and_write`'s `render_dossier(...)` / `write_dossier(...)` calls, whose signatures Task D changes. Building D first means A/B/C get written against the final signatures instead of twice.

---

## Task D — Template, frontmatter, filename, identity fixes

### D.1 — `date_posted` epoch → ISO string

**File:** `vault_writer/writer.py`, `build_frontmatter()` (line 41-59).

Change line 53 from:
```python
"date_posted": listing.date_posted,
```
to convert epoch → `YYYY-MM-DD` string, `None` stays `None`:
```python
"date_posted": date.fromtimestamp(listing.date_posted).isoformat() if listing.date_posted else None,
```
Add `from datetime import date` import. Use UTC-safe conversion — check whether `date_posted` values are always UTC epoch (they are: `_parse_iso_ts` in `normalize.py` does `datetime.fromisoformat(s).timestamp()`, naive local-assumed). `datetime.fromtimestamp` uses local system time, which is a latent bug (already present in the codebase, not introduced here) — use `datetime.fromtimestamp(x, tz=timezone.utc).date().isoformat()` for correctness since `_parse_iso_ts` treats input as if it's a real timestamp. Flag this as a minor drive-by fix, not scope creep — one line, same file already being touched.

### D.2 — Drop `uid`/`category` from frontmatter + local UID manifest

**Files:** `vault_writer/writer.py`, `recheck.py`, new `state/dossier_uids.json`.

`build_frontmatter()`: delete the `"uid": uid,` and `"category": listing.category or None,` lines. Signature stays `build_frontmatter(listing, uid, date_found, matched_reason)` — `uid` param is still needed by the manifest-writing step, just not rendered.

`write_dossier()` new signature:
```python
def write_dossier(vault_root, uid: str, markdown: str, filename: str) -&gt; Path:
```
(filename comes from Task D.4's collision-safe naming — see below; `write_dossier` no longer computes the filename itself from `slugify_uid`). After writing the file, call a new function:
```python
def _record_uid(state_dir: Path, vault_relative_path: str, uid: str) -&gt; None:
    manifest = load_dossier_uids(state_dir)
    manifest[vault_relative_path] = uid
    save_dossier_uids(state_dir, manifest)
```
Mirror `load_seen_ids`/`save_seen_ids` from `run_pipeline.py` (same read-json-or-empty-dict, write-sorted pattern) as two new functions `load_dossier_uids(path) -&gt; dict` / `save_dossier_uids(path, manifest: dict) -&gt; None` in `vault_writer/writer.py` itself (co-located with `write_dossier`, since that's the only writer) — **not** in `run_pipeline.py`, because `recheck.py` needs to read this file too and currently does not import from `run_pipeline.py` for state I/O (it imports `file_github_issue` from there, but that's a one-off; adding a writer-state dependency into `run_pipeline.py` would be the wrong direction — `run_pipeline.py` already imports `write_dossier` from `vault_writer.writer`, so put the manifest helpers there too, and have `run_pipeline.py`'s `write_dossier` caller pass the manifest path through).

Open design question I'm resolving explicitly: **does `write_dossier` take a manifest path as a new param, or does the caller (`validate_and_write`) manage the manifest separately?** Recommendation: `write_dossier` takes an optional `state_dir=None` param; if given, it writes the manifest entry as a side effect right after `path.write_text(...)`. This keeps `write_dossier` as the single place a file is ever written for a uid (consistent with the existing docstring "write_dossier() itself does not re-run the write gate" — it owns writing). `run_pipeline.py`'s `validate_and_write` call site passes `state_dir=Path(__file__).parent / "state"` equivalent — actually cleanest: `run_pipeline.py` passes it down from `run_once`'s existing `state_path` pattern. Concretely:

```python
# vault_writer/writer.py
DOSSIER_UIDS_FILENAME = "dossier_uids.json"

def load_dossier_uids(state_dir) -&gt; dict:
    path = Path(state_dir) / DOSSIER_UIDS_FILENAME
    if not path.exists():
        return {}
    return json.loads(path.read_text())

def save_dossier_uids(state_dir, manifest: dict) -&gt; None:
    path = Path(state_dir) / DOSSIER_UIDS_FILENAME
    path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    path.write_text(json.dumps(manifest, indent=2, sort_keys=True) + "\n")

def write_dossier(vault_root, uid: str, markdown: str, filename: str, state_dir=None) -&gt; Path:
    dossiers_dir = Path(vault_root) / DOSSIER_SUBPATH / &lt;bucket subfolder from Task C&gt;
    dossiers_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    path = dossiers_dir / filename
    path.write_text(markdown)
    if state_dir is not None:
        manifest = load_dossier_uids(state_dir)
        manifest[str(path.relative_to(vault_root))] = uid
        save_dossier_uids(state_dir, manifest)
    return path
```
Add `import json` to `vault_writer/writer.py` (not currently imported there).

`run_pipeline.py` call site (inside `validate_and_write`, line 192): change `write_dossier(jarvis_dir, uid, markdown)` → `write_dossier(jarvis_dir, uid, markdown, filename, state_dir=REPO_STATE_DIR)`. `validate_and_write` needs a new `state_dir` parameter threaded from `run_once` (which already has `state_path` — derive `state_dir = Path(state_path).parent`, or pass state_dir explicitly as its own param mirroring `opt_cache_path`). Recommendation: add `state_dir` param to `run_once` and `validate_and_write` explicitly (don't derive from `state_path`'s parent implicitly — too fragile if someone passes a `state_path` outside the expected dir structure) — the `__main__` block passes `state_dir=REPO_ROOT / "state"`.

`recheck.py` changes: `plan_removals()` (line 57-71) currently does `source, _, raw_id = fm["uid"].partition(":")`. Since `fm` (from `scan_dossiers`) no longer has `uid` in frontmatter, AND `scan_dossiers` itself currently filters on `fm.get("uid")` truthy (line 93 of writer.py) — **this also needs to change**, since it would now silently drop every dossier. Update `scan_dossiers` to keep all frontmatter dicts with a `company` key (or just always keep dicts with any content) since uid is no longer the truth-filter — company is guaranteed present per `check_required_fields`. Then `recheck.py.main()` needs to load the manifest (`load_dossier_uids(state_dir)`) once, and `plan_removals` needs a new signature `plan_removals(dossiers, feeds_by_source, uid_by_path: dict) -&gt; list`, looking up `uid_by_path[str(fm["_path"].relative_to(jarvis_dir))]` instead of `fm["uid"]`. Handle the case where a dossier file exists in the vault but has no manifest entry (e.g. one of the ~50 pre-existing flat-root dossiers, or the hand-edited Ellipsis Labs file, written before this change and never uid-recorded) — these must be **skipped, not crashed on or treated as removable** (same "unknown = leave alone" philosophy as the fetch-failure branch already uses). Concretely: `if vault_rel_path not in uid_by_path: continue`.

**Also:** `scan_dossiers` is used by `validate_and_write` for `dossier_keys` (cross-source dup check) via `fm.get("company","")`/`fm.get("title","")` — unaffected by dropping `uid` since it never reads `uid` for that purpose, only for the truthy-filter which is being relaxed anyway.

### D.3 — `promoted:` → `next:`

**File:** `vault_writer/writer.py`, line 57. Change `"promoted": None,` → `"next": None,`. Purely mechanical; `REQUIRED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` in `validate.py` gets the corresponding rename (see below).

### D.4 — Filename convention

**File:** `vault_writer/writer.py`. New function, replacing the filename-computation half of `write_dossier` (keep `slugify_uid` — see below):

```python
_ILLEGAL_FILENAME_CHARS = re.compile(r'[\/:*?"&lt;&gt;|\n\r\t]')

def dossier_filename(role: str, company: str, existing_names: set) -&gt; str:
    """'[Role] - [Company].md', filesystem-illegal chars stripped, collision
    tie-broken with ' (2)', ' (3)', ... Matches the candidate's own hand-
    renamed 'Software Engineer - Ellipsis Labs.md'."""
    def sanitize(s: str) -&gt; str:
        return _ILLEGAL_FILENAME_CHARS.sub("", s).strip()
    base = f"{sanitize(role)} - {sanitize(company)}"
    name = f"{base}.md"
    n = 2
    while name in existing_names:
        name = f"{base} ({n}).md"
        n += 1
    return name
```
`existing_names` = the set of `.md` filenames already present in the **target subfolder** (Task C routes into 4 different subfolders, so collisions are checked per-folder, computed via `{p.name for p in target_dir.glob("*.md")}` right before writing — `write_dossier` computes this itself since it already does `dossiers_dir.mkdir(...)`).

Test the `Fussball Club Cincinnati LLC ("FC Cincinnati")` case explicitly: quotes and parens are NOT in `_ILLEGAL_FILENAME_CHARS` (parens/quotes are legal on Linux/Mac ext4/APFS, only `/` is truly illegal cross-platform along with `:` and a few Windows-only chars since the vault syncs via git and may be opened on Windows too — the WSL path `/mnt/d/...` confirms a Windows host). Keep `&lt;&gt;|"` and `:` `*` `?` stripped for Windows-safety since the vault lives on a Windows filesystem. So `Fussball Club Cincinnati LLC ("FC Cincinnati")` → quotes stripped → `Fussball Club Cincinnati LLC (FC Cincinnati)` (parens kept, they're legal everywhere).

`slugify_uid`: **keep it**, do not rename or delete. It's still used for `opt_cache` keys? No — checked: `opt_cache` keys off `uid` directly (`opt_cache[uid] = ...`), not the slug. Grep confirms the only real caller is `write_dossier`'s old filename computation (being removed) and `tests/test_writer.py`'s `test_slugify_uid_is_filesystem_safe` and the two tests that build `expected_path` from it. Since `slugify_uid` becomes dead production code once `write_dossier` stops calling it, the right call per ponytail (delete unused code) is to **delete `slugify_uid` entirely** and update/delete its test — but the task prompt explicitly says "check for other callers... before deciding whether to keep, rename, or delete." Grep result: no other production callers exist outside `writer.py` and `tests/test_writer.py`. Recommendation: **delete `slugify_uid`** and delete `test_slugify_uid_is_filesystem_safe` (replace with a new `test_dossier_filename_sanitizes_illegal_chars` test using the Fussball Club Cincinnati example). This is a judgment call the user should confirm — noted below in Open Questions — since the task's own phrasing ("still used by tests... plan how those tests need to change") suggests they may want it kept as a general-purpose slug utility even if currently orphaned. Ponytail default: delete it, it's dead weight once its one caller is gone.

### D.5 — Header

**File:** `vault_writer/templates/dossier.md.j2`, line 3: `# {{ company }} — {{ title }}` → `# {{ title }}`.

### D.6 — Intro rewrite

**File:** `vault_writer/templates/dossier.md.j2`, lines 4 and 7. Replace both branches per the HUMAN_WRITING.md bar — drop the pipeline-mechanics narration, state facts only:

```jinja2
{% if posting_content %}Found {{ date_found }} via {{ source }}.
## Posting (fetched {{ date_found }})
{{ posting_content }}
{%- else %}Found {{ date_found }} via {{ source }}. No posting content fetched.
{%- endif %}
```
Both branches keep it to one short factual sentence, no `[[30_Order/Workflows/Internship Pipeline]]` link (per the task's lean-toward-dropping guidance) and no mention of "enrichment happens on promotion" (that's pipeline-internal mechanics the reader doesn't need restated on every single note — the workflow note itself already documents that). This is a judgment call worth a one-line confirmation from the user since it removes an existing internal cross-reference link — flagged in Open Questions.

### D.7 — Ashby Description-section extraction bug

**Files:** `ingestion/posting_page.py`, new diagnostic script (scratchpad, not committed), new fixture `tests/fixtures/posting_ashby_&lt;company&gt;.md`, `tests/test_posting_page.py`.

Step 1 (implementation-time, live): write a throwaway diagnostic script (in the scratchpad dir, not the repo) that calls `fetch_posting_markdown` directly against a live Ashby-hosted URL — the Ellipsis Labs URL from the dossier (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/ellipsislabs/[REDACTED]/application`) or another `ASHBY_COMPANIES` entry if that one has since closed — using the real `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` env var. Print the raw markdown in full. Inspect around the `### Description` heading:
- If real content is there but `_CUT_MARKERS` or `_NOISE` ate it → the fix is a regex adjustment in `posting_page.py` (tighten a pattern so it stops false-matching a legitimate line).
- If the raw markdown genuinely has an empty/collapsed Description section → the fix is likely `waitFor` bump or an `actions` array (e.g. `{"type": "wait", "milliseconds": ...}` or a scroll/click action) in `fetch_posting_markdown`'s Firecrawl payload, gated behind `"ashbyhq.com" in url` so Greenhouse/other ATS behavior is untouched — add a new small helper, e.g. `_scrape_payload(url)` that returns the base payload plus Ashby-specific extras, used by `fetch_posting_markdown`.
- If heading-detection (`s.startswith("#") and len(s) &gt; 4`) skips into the wrong section → adjust the `started` trigger logic in `extract_content`.

Do not commit to which of these three ahead of the live capture — this is explicitly stated in the task as not derivable statically.

Step 2: once the raw markdown is captured, save it as `tests/fixtures/posting_ashby_&lt;company&gt;.md` (pattern-match `posting_fiverings.md`), and add `test_extract_content_from_real_ashby_page` to `tests/test_posting_page.py` asserting the Description section text is present and non-empty (mirroring `test_extract_content_from_real_page`'s assertions: starts with expected heading, contains an expected substring from the real Description text, no `\n\n`, no bare `---` lines).

Step 3: apply whichever code fix the investigation points to, re-run the diagnostic script to confirm, then run `pytest tests/test_posting_page.py -v`.

### D — Ripple: `vault_writer/validate.py`

`REQUIRED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` (line 13-16) change from:
```python
("uid", "company", "title", "url", "source", "category", "terms", "locations",
 "target_year", "date_posted", "date_found", "matched_reason", "status", "promoted", "tags")
```
to:
```python
("company", "title", "url", "source", "terms", "locations",
 "target_year", "date_posted", "date_found", "matched_reason", "status", "next", "tags")
```
`REQUIRED_LISTING_FIELDS` (line 12, `("company", "title", "url", "source", "uid")`) is **unchanged** — that's about the `Listing`+uid pairing passed into `validate()`, not the rendered frontmatter, and `uid` remains a live Python value throughout the pipeline (used for dedup, `opt_cache`, the manifest). `check_required_fields` still works exactly as-is.

### D — Ripple: `tests/test_writer.py`

Rewrite substantially since `write_dossier`'s signature changes (`filename` param added, `state_dir` param added) and `slugify_uid` is deleted:
- `test_slugify_uid_is_filesystem_safe` → **delete**, replace with `test_dossier_filename_sanitizes_illegal_chars` (assert `dossier_filename("Software Engineer", 'Fussball Club Cincinnati LLC ("FC Cincinnati")', set())` produces a `.md`-safe name with no `"` chars) and `test_dossier_filename_collision_appends_number` (assert calling it twice with the same `existing_names` set produces `"... (2).md"`).
- `test_write_dossier_writes_expected_file`, `test_write_dossier_is_idempotent_on_uid`, `test_write_dossier_creates_missing_dossiers_dir`: update calls to pass `filename=dossier_filename(listing.title, listing.company, set())` explicitly, and update `expected_path` computation accordingly (no longer via `slugify_uid`). Note: idempotency changes meaning — write_dossier is no longer "idempotent on uid" via filename since filename is now role+company, not uid-derived; if the same uid is written twice with the same role/company, the *existing* collision-avoidance would create `(2)` instead of overwriting, which is a **behavior change** worth flagging: is that acceptable, or does the pipeline still need true idempotent-on-uid overwrite behavior (e.g. re-running a corrected render for the same uid same day)? Flagged below in Open Questions — recommend keeping true idempotency by checking the manifest first: if `uid` is already a value in `load_dossier_uids(state_dir)`, reuse that entry's existing filename/path instead of collision-appending a new one.
- Add `test_write_dossier_records_uid_manifest` (new): calls `write_dossier(..., state_dir=tmp_path/"state")`, then asserts `load_dossier_uids(tmp_path/"state")` maps the written vault-relative path to the uid.
- The `throwaway_vault` fixture skeleton itself needs **no change** — `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` in `write_dossier` already creates whatever subfolder Task C routes into on demand, confirmed by the existing `test_write_dossier_creates_missing_dossiers_dir` pattern.

### D — Ripple: `tests/test_validate.py`

Every call to `render_dossier(...)` in this file still works unchanged (its own signature isn't touched by D — only `build_frontmatter`'s internal dict and the template are). But assertions that indirectly depend on frontmatter shape need a read-through: `test_format_compliance_rejects_missing_frontmatter_field` (line 122) strips `matched_reason:` — still valid, unaffected. No test here asserts on `uid`/`category`/`promoted` presence directly, so this file likely needs **no changes** — confirm by running it after D lands; if it passes untouched, leave it. (I did not find any assertion keying off those three fields in the file as read.)

### D — Ripple: `run_pipeline.py`

`validate_and_write` line 166 and 185-186 call `render_dossier(listing, uid, date_found, build_matched_reason(...), posting_content)` — **unchanged**, `render_dossier`'s own signature isn't touched by D.1-D.3 (those only change what's inside `build_frontmatter`'s dict and the template). Only the `write_dossier(...)` call (line 192) changes as described in D.2/D.4, and this is also exactly where Task C's routing plugs in (see below) — so this call site gets touched twice; plan them together in the actual diff.

---

## Task A — CS/software-relevance gate

### New module: `core/relevance.py`

Mirrors `core/filter.py`'s style: pure functions, `_norm()`-style helpers, no LLM, extensive doc-comments justifying each keyword choice with a real example.

```python
"""Layer 2.5 — CS/software-relevance gate. Runs after matches() passes, before
the write gate. Two-stage: cheap title/raw_text reject (stage 1, no fetch),
then content-based confirm/reject for adjacent fields (stage 2, needs the
fetched posting page). Zero-LLM, deterministic, same keyword-heuristic style
as filter.py.

Persona: BS Computer Science, full-stack + AI/ML + backend/systems skillset
(see Main Resume.md / Engineer Edge Roadmap.md). A posting passes if its real
duties involve software/CS work — writing code, building systems, APIs, ML,
data pipelines, testing, debugging — even if the company is in an adjacent
industry (space, robotics, astrophysics, automotive/hardware) or has
'hardware' in its name. A posting fails if it's fundamentally non-technical
(financial/risk analyst, tax preparer, sports performance analytics) even at
a company that also does real engineering elsewhere."""
import re

def _norm(s: str) -&gt; str:
    return re.sub(r"\s+", " ", s).strip().lower()

# Stage 1: title/raw_text-only, no network. Deliberately narrow — false

# unambiguous non-software title patterns go here. "Tax Technology Intern"

# these patterns require the non-software noun to be the role itself, not a
# domain qualifier ahead of "Engineer"/"Developer"/"Technology"/etc.

```

### Integration — `run_pipeline.py`

Stage 1: inside `fetch_and_filter` (line 107-113), add the reject right alongside `matches()`:
```python
results[name] = {
    "fetch_count": len(listings),
    "matched": [l for l in listings if matches(l, profile) and not stage1_reject(l.title, l.raw_text)],
}
```
Import `from core.relevance import stage1_reject, stage2_confirm` at the top.

Stage 2: inside `validate_and_write`, in the `if page_md:` block (line 177-191), right after `posting_content = extract_content(page_md)` (line 184) and before the `opt_exclusion` check — actually order matters less between OPT and relevance since both are content-based rejects; put relevance check first since it's cheaper conceptually and semantically "is this even a CS role" should gate before "is this OPT-eligible":
```python
if page_md:
    posting_content = extract_content(page_md)
    if not stage2_confirm(listing.title, listing.company, posting_content):
        rejections.append({"uid": uid, "check": "cs_relevance", "reason": "adjacent-field posting, no software signal in content"})
        continue
    signal = opt_exclusion(page_md)
    ...
```
Fail-open case (`page_md` empty — fetch failed or `fetch_page_fn is None`): stage 2 never runs at all (it's inside the existing `if page_md:` block), so the listing proceeds with the thin dossier, unclassified content-wise. This matches the task's explicit design decision — state it as a comment above the check: `# Fail-open: no fetched content means no adjacent-field signal to check either way — permissive by design, same as every other content-gated check in this pipeline (opt_exclusion, below).`

### New test file: `tests/test_relevance.py`

Pattern: mirror `test_filter.py`'s inline-`Listing`-construction style (no fixture JSON needed, same reasoning as Greenhouse/Ashby/AIJobs cases — free text needs real variety, not fixture files).

- `[REDACTED]` — construct with a title pulled from a real live Greenhouse company board fetched during implementation (Aquatic Capital Management / Walleye Capital / PDT Partners are quant-trading Greenhouse boards seeded in `sources.py`, likely posting "Risk Analyst Intern"/"Tax Intern" alongside SWE roles — **implementation-time step: fetch these boards live, confirm an actual non-software title exists, use its real text**). If no real title turns up on a live check, fall back to FC Cincinnati's Greenhouse board (soccer club — very likely has "Sports Performance Analyst"-shaped postings, not "Sports Performance Analytics" verbatim as originally guessed but confirm live).
- `[REDACTED]` — uses the **already-existing real fixture** `tests/fixtures/simplifyjobs.json`'s "Tax Technology Intern - Summer 2027" (category `AI/ML/Data`) entry, loaded via `normalize_simplify`, asserting `stage1_reject(listing.title, "")` is `False`. This is a real, already-committed fixture — no new file needed.
- `[REDACTED]` — construct `Listing(title="Autonomous Driving – Internship in Machine Learning", company="Robert Bosch Venture Capital", ...)`, pass in the real posting-content text copied from the vault dossier `[REDACTED].md`'s `## Posting` section (the Job Description/Responsibilities/Qualifications text, which mentions Python/data pipelines/model training), assert `stage2_confirm(...)` is `True`.
- `[REDACTED]` — same pattern using the Magna dossier's real content (Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, data/ML pipeline, cloud platforms).
- `[REDACTED]` — a plain "Software Engineer Intern" title/company with no adjacent-field hint returns `True` regardless of content (even empty content), asserting the short-circuit.
- `[REDACTED]` — **implementation-time step**: needs a real adjacent-field posting whose actual content is genuinely non-software (e.g., a pure hardware-assembly/manufacturing-floor internship at a space or automotive company with zero code/API/pipeline mentions). Search the live Greenhouse/Ashby seeded boards or the raw SimplifyJobs/zshah101/JGCL feeds for a real example during implementation; if none turns up among the currently-seeded sources, this is worth flagging back to the user rather than inventing synthetic text — see Open Questions.

## Task B — Priority classification

### New module: `core/classify.py`

```python
"""Layer 2.5b — priority-bucket classification for listings that already
passed Task A's relevance gate. Deterministic keyword matching against
title + category + fetched posting content. Exactly one bucket, in this
priority order (first match wins, since a posting can legitimately show
signals for more than one — e.g. an 'AI infra' role at a fintech is AI/ML,
not CyS &amp; Finance, so AI/ML is checked first):
  1. AI/ML       — LLM, RAG, agents, ML infra, applied AI, deep learning
  2. CyS &amp; Finance — security or finance-adjacent software engineering
  3. Fullstack   — product/frontend/backend/systems engineering
  4. Other       — real software engineering (Task A already confirmed),
                   matching none of the above

def classify(title: str, category: str, posting_content: str) -&gt; tuple:
    """Returns (bucket_name, callout_signal) — callout_signal is the specific

        m = pattern.search(haystack)
        if m:
            return bucket, m.group(0)
    return "Other", ""
```

Real-example sanity check against fixtures already read: Bosch's "Autonomous Driving – Internship in Machine Learning" content ("model training", "AI-enabled") → AI/ML bucket. Magna's Computer Vision content ("TensorFlow or PyTorch") → AI/ML bucket. Ellipsis Labs "Software Engineer" (DeFi company, generalist SWE role, no explicit security/crypto-engineering keyword in its own duties per the dossier — "you will:" bullets are generic backend/systems work) → likely Fullstack or Other depending on exact bullet text; worth reading its full "you will:" section during implementation to confirm which bucket it should land in, since it's the one real end-to-end example available.

### Callout format

New helper, same module or `vault_writer/writer.py` — used by the template:
```python
def classification_callout(bucket: str, signal: str) -&gt; str:
    if not signal:
        return f"&gt; [!NOTE] {bucket}: genuine software engineering role, no bucket-specific signal matched."
    return f"&gt; [!NOTE] {bucket}: matched on \"{signal}\"."
```
No numeric label anywhere — matches the explicit design-review rejection of "Priority 1/2/3" callouts. Rendered into the template as a new Jinja var `classification_callout`.

### Template change — `vault_writer/templates/dossier.md.j2`

Add the callout line after the intro sentence, before the `## Posting` heading (in both branches):
```jinja2
{% if posting_content %}Found {{ date_found }} via {{ source }}.
{{ classification_callout }}
## Posting (fetched {{ date_found }})
{{ posting_content }}
{%- else %}Found {{ date_found }} via {{ source }}. No posting content fetched.
{%- endif %}
```
Note: `check_format_compliance`'s blank-line rule allows a blank line only immediately after a line starting with `&gt;` — a callout followed directly by `## Posting` (no blank line) satisfies the "no disallowed blank line" rule as-is, since there's no blank line inserted between them at all. Verify this renders clean by running `check_format_compliance` on a sample render during implementation before committing the template change.

`render_dossier()` signature gains one param: `render_dossier(listing, uid, date_found, matched_reason, posting_content="", classification_callout="")`. Default empty string means degraded-signal case (no content fetched, or classification not yet run) still renders valid markdown — but per Task C's "every written dossier needs a bucket" rule, `validate_and_write` always computes a real bucket before calling `render_dossier`, so the default only matters for callers that don't go through the full pipeline (e.g. any ad-hoc test calling `render_dossier` directly with 4 positional args) — confirm this doesn't break the many existing `render_dossier(listing, uid, "2026-07-17", "reason")` calls across `tests/test_writer.py`, `tests/test_validate.py`, `tests/test_run_pipeline.py` (they'll all still work since the two new params are keyword-defaulted).

### Integration — `run_pipeline.py`

Inside `validate_and_write`'s `if page_md:` block, after the stage-2 relevance check passes and before/alongside the OPT check:
```python
if page_md:
    posting_content = extract_content(page_md)
    if not stage2_confirm(listing.title, listing.company, posting_content):
        rejections.append(...); continue
    signal = opt_exclusion(page_md)
    if signal:
        ...continue
    bucket, callout_signal = classify(listing.title, listing.category, posting_content)
    enriched = render_dossier(listing, uid, date_found, build_matched_reason(listing, profile),
                              posting_content, classification_callout(bucket, callout_signal))
    if check_format_compliance(enriched).passed:
        markdown = enriched
else:
    bucket, _ = classify(listing.title, listing.category, "")  # degraded signal, title+category only
```
The `else` branch (fail-open / no content) still needs a `bucket` value since Task C requires routing every write into one of the 4 folders — `classify` degrades gracefully since an empty `posting_content` string simply contributes zero regex hits, title/category alone still register. Also handle the thin-dossier case (`fetch_page_fn is None` entirely, or `page_page_fn` set but exception raised): same `else` path.

### New test file: `tests/test_classify.py`

Mirror `test_filter.py`/`test_relevance.py`'s inline construction pattern:
- `test_classify_ai_ml_from_bosch_content` — real Bosch dossier text → `("AI/ML", &lt;matched phrase&gt;)`.
- `test_classify_ai_ml_from_magna_content` — real Magna dossier text (mentions "TensorFlow or PyTorch") → `("AI/ML", ...)`.
- `test_classify_fullstack_signal` — construct from a real title, e.g. one of the fixture titles like "Cloud Platform Engineer Intern, Growth" (vanshb03.json, Poshmark) → likely `("Fullstack", ...)` given "platform engineer" hits `_FULLSTACK_RE` — verify during implementation which pattern actually fires first and adjust the test's expected bucket to match, don't guess blind.
- `test_classify_other_when_no_bucket_signal_matches` — a generic real SWE title/content with no AI/security/fullstack keyword (implementation-time: find a real example among the fixtures — "Software Engineering Intern | Example Co" fixtures are placeholder-named, so use a real one like Anduril's "2027 Software Engineer Intern" from zshah101.json, checking its actual raw_text/category for whether it accidentally trips a bucket regex).
- `test_classification_callout_format_has_no_numeric_label` — assert `classification_callout("AI/ML", "rag")` does NOT match `re.search(r"Priority\s*\d", ...)`, and does start with `&gt; [!NOTE] AI/ML:`.

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_classify.py -v`.

---

## Task C — Route into vault subfolders

### `vault_writer/writer.py`

`DOSSIER_SUBPATH` stays as the base (`10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers`). `write_dossier`'s dossiers_dir computation changes to append the bucket folder:
```python
def write_dossier(vault_root, uid: str, markdown: str, filename: str, bucket_folder: str, state_dir=None) -&gt; Path:
    dossiers_dir = Path(vault_root) / DOSSIER_SUBPATH / bucket_folder
    dossiers_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    path = dossiers_dir / filename
    ...
```
`bucket_folder` is `classify.BUCKET_FOLDERS[bucket]` (`"1 - AI &amp; ML"`, `"2 - Fullstack"`, `"3 - CyS &amp; Finance"`, `"Other"`) — computed by the caller (`run_pipeline.py`), not inside `write_dossier` itself, keeping `writer.py` free of a dependency on `core/classify.py` (avoids a circular-ish import direction; `vault_writer` shouldn't need to know about classification buckets, just where to put a file it's told to put).

**Do not write into or touch `Viewed/`** — confirmed no code path references it; nothing to guard against beyond simply never adding it to `BUCKET_FOLDERS`.

**Do not migrate the ~50 existing flat-root dossiers** — no code change needed for this since `write_dossier` only ever writes new files at the (new, correct) computed path; the old ones simply stay where they are, untouched by any write path. `scan_dossiers` (used for cross-source dedup) needs to keep scanning recursively across all 4 new subfolders **plus** the flat root, otherwise old dossiers stop counting toward `dossier_keys` and could get silently re-written as duplicates in a new bucket folder. Check: `scan_dossiers`'s current glob (`dossiers_dir.glob("*.md")`, line 90) is **non-recursive** — it will miss anything now written into subfolders. **This must change to `dossiers_dir.glob("**/*.md")` (recursive)** or equivalent, verified to still pick up the flat-root files too (glob `**/*.md` from the `Dossiers/` root matches both `Dossiers/foo.md` and `Dossiers/1 - AI &amp; ML/bar.md`). This is a required fix, not optional — flag it clearly since it wasn't explicitly named in the task list but directly follows from Task C's subfolder routing.

### `run_pipeline.py`

`validate_and_write`'s call site becomes:
```python
write_dossier(jarvis_dir, uid, markdown, filename, bucket_folder, state_dir=state_dir)
```
where `filename = dossier_filename(listing.title, listing.company, existing_names_in_bucket_folder)` — `existing_names_in_bucket_folder` requires listing the target subfolder's current contents, which means the filename-collision check must happen *after* the bucket is known (i.e., after `classify()` runs, inside the `if page_md: ... else: ...` branching described in Task B). Concretely, compute `filename` right before the `write_dossier(...)` call, not earlier.

### Ripple: `tests/test_writer.py`, `tests/test_run_pipeline.py`

- `test_writer.py`: every `write_dossier(...)` call needs a `bucket_folder` arg now; add a `test_write_dossier_routes_into_bucket_subfolder` asserting the file lands at `vault_root / DOSSIERS_SUBPATH / "1 - AI &amp; ML" / filename`.
- `test_run_pipeline.py`: `test_validate_and_write_happy_path` and friends (lines 173-251) will need updating for the new `write_dossier` call signature indirectly (they call `run_pipeline.validate_and_write(...)`, not `write_dossier` directly, so only break if `validate_and_write`'s own external signature changes — it doesn't, apart from possibly adding `state_dir`). Read this file's exact assertions during implementation to confirm none hardcode the old flat `dossiers_dir / f"{slugify_uid(uid)}.md"` path shape — if any do (likely, since they probably assert on file existence at a specific path), update those path assertions to expect the new bucket-subfolder + role-company filename shape.
- `test_validate_and_write_seeds_dedup_keys_from_existing_vault_files` (line 228): this test's whole point is that `scan_dossiers` picks up pre-existing files — re-verify it still passes once `scan_dossiers`'s glob becomes recursive; if the test fixture writes its seed file into the flat root (likely, matching the throwaway_vault skeleton), no change needed there, just confirm.

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_writer.py tests/test_run_pipeline.py -v`.

## Task E — Contact-research widening (`enrich.py`)

### 1. Recruiter/university-recruiting search queries

After the existing blog-search block (line 133-139), add:
```python
_EXCLUDED_CONTACT_DOMAINS_RE = re.compile(
    r"indeed\.com|glassdoor\.com|simplify\.jobs|linkedin\.com/jobs/", re.I,
)

def _search_and_filter(query: str, key: str) -&gt; list:
    return [h for h in fc_search(query, key) if not _EXCLUDED_CONTACT_DOMAINS_RE.search(h.get("url", ""))]
```
(Verify SimplifyJobs' actual domain during implementation — `grep -rn "simplify" ingestion/sources.py README.md PRD.md` or check the live site; the task names "simplify.jobs" as the likely domain but this needs a live confirm before hardcoding, since a wrong guess here would silently under-filter rather than error, same failure mode already documented for `sources.py` company tokens.)

```python
for query, label in ((f"{company} recruiter", "recruiter search"), (f"{company} university recruiting", "university recruiting search")):
    for hit in _search_and_filter(query, key):
        name = hit.get("title", "").strip()
        if name:
            contacts.append((name, f"{label}: {hit['url']}"))
            sources.append(hit["url"])
```
Placed after the GitHub-org-member block (after line 144), before the `mx`/`rows` computation, so these contacts flow through the exact same `infer_email`/MX-check/table-row pipeline already built (line 146-151) — no new markdown-building logic needed, just new `contacts` entries with a distinguishing source-label string (already how blog bylines and GitHub members are distinguished: `f"blog byline ({blog_url})"` vs `f"{n}, {u}"` for GitHub — the new label strings `"recruiter search: &lt;url&gt;"` / `"university recruiting search: &lt;url&gt;"` follow the same "source string embeds context" convention, no schema change needed).

Note: `hit.get("title", "")` as a "name" is a guess about Firecrawl's real `/search` response shape (the task itself flags this: "the plan needs to note that Firecrawl's real `/search` response shape likely includes `title`/`description` snippet fields per hit — standard search-API shape"). **Implementation-time step: make one live `fc_search` call during implementation and print the raw hit dict to confirm the actual field names** (`title`, `description`, or something else) before finalizing this code — do not ship this against a guessed field name untested.

### 2. LinkedIn search-snippet lookup (search only, never scrape)

New standalone function, with the explicit ceiling comment the task requires:
```python
def linkedin_recruiter_snippet(company: str, key: str) -&gt; list:
    # Search-snippet text only — NEVER fc_scrape() or otherwise fetch the
    # underlying linkedin.com URL; that crosses the login-wall rule in this
    # module's docstring above. Whatever text Firecrawl's search-result
    # snippet itself contains (title/description fields) is all we ever see.
    hits = fc_search(f"site:linkedin.com {company} recruiter", key)
    return [(h.get("title", ""), h.get("description", ""), h.get("url", "")) for h in hits if "linkedin.com" in h.get("url", "")]
```
Called once per company in `main()`, results appended to `contacts`/`sources` with a `"linkedin search snippet"` label, same table-row pipeline. Since these are raw snippets (not necessarily a clean parsed name), `infer_email` may not apply cleanly if `title` isn't a "First Last" shape — acceptable, the existing `rows` loop already handles `email is None` gracefully (renders `—`).

### Ripple: `tests/test_enrich.py`

Add offline tests for the new pure logic (per the file's own docstring rule — "no network"):
- `test_excluded_contact_domains_filters_indeed_glassdoor_simplify_linkedin_jobs` — call `_search_and_filter`-adjacent filter logic directly with a mocked `fc_search` (patch `enrich.fc_search`) returning a mix of allowed/excluded-domain hits, assert only allowed ones survive.
- `test_linkedin_recruiter_snippet_never_calls_fc_scrape` — patch `enrich.fc_scrape` with a `Mock(side_effect=AssertionError(...))`, call `linkedin_recruiter_snippet`, assert `fc_scrape` was never invoked — this is the one hard-guarantee test that actually enforces the ceiling comment, not just documents it.

Run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_enrich.py -v`.

---

## Task F (optional) — Expand `GREENHOUSE_COMPANIES`/`ASHBY_COMPANIES`

Not plannable statically per the task's own framing. Implementation-time steps only:
1. Identify 5-10 candidate AI/ML-adjacent companies known to use Greenhouse or Ashby for their job boards (e.g., check company career pages for `job-boards.greenhouse.io/&lt;token&gt;` or `jobs.ashbyhq.com/&lt;token&gt;` URLs).
2. For each candidate token, hit `GREENHOUSE_JOBS_URL.format(token=...)` / `ASHBY_JOBS_URL.format(token=...)` live and confirm it returns real job data (non-empty `jobs` array), per the exact verification standard already documented in the `sources.py` comment above `GREENHOUSE_COMPANIES` (line 24-29).
3. Only add tokens confirmed live this session — never a guessed token.
4. `tests/test_sources.py` needs no changes (asserts `len(sources.GREENHOUSE_COMPANIES)` dynamically, confirmed by reading the file).
5. Time-box this — explicitly optional, do only after A-E are done and tested.

---

## Suggested implementation order

1. Task D (writer/validate/template/identity — foundation everything else builds on).
2. Task A (relevance gate — new module, cheap to build/test in isolation).
3. Task B (classification — depends on A having run first conceptually, but is a separate module).
4. Task C (routing — thin, depends on B's bucket output and D's write_dossier signature).
5. Full-suite regression run: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v`.
6. Task E (independent of A-D, can be done any time, touches only `enrich.py`).
7. Task F (optional, time-permitting).

---

## Open questions / judgment calls to confirm before implementation

1. **`slugify_uid` deletion (Task D.4).** It becomes dead code once `write_dossier` no longer uses it for filenames. Recommend deleting it and its test. Confirm this is acceptable, or if it should be kept as a general-purpose utility despite no current caller.

2. **True write-idempotency on uid (Task D.4 ripple).** The old `write_dossier` was "idempotent on uid" — re-running the same uid overwrote the same file. The new role+company filename scheme with collision-append (`(2)`, `(3)`) would, without a manifest lookup, create duplicate files for a legitimately re-rendered same-uid write within one run/day. Recommend: `write_dossier` checks `load_dossier_uids(state_dir)` for an existing filename mapped to this `uid` first, and reuses/overwrites that path instead of collision-incrementing, only using the collision-append logic for a genuinely different uid landing on the same role+company name. Confirm this is the desired behavior — it adds a manifest-read to every write, which is cheap (small JSON file) but is a real behavior decision, not just plumbing.

3. **D.6 intro rewrite drops the `[[30_Order/Workflows/Internship Pipeline]]` link entirely.** This removes an existing internal cross-reference from every future dossier. Confirm this is desired (the task leans this way but doesn't mandate it) versus keeping a bare link with no narration around it.

4. **Task A stage-1 reject list breadth.** The confirmed reject categories (financial/risk analyst, tax, sports performance analytics) don't have real *rejected* examples sitting in the vault by definition (rejected items never get written there). Plan resolves this by using the small curated `tests/fixtures/*.json` files (already containing "Tax Technology Intern" as a **must-not-reject** example) plus implementation-time live fetches of the FC Cincinnati / quant-trading Greenhouse boards for genuine reject examples. Confirm this live-fetch-during-implementation approach is acceptable, versus wanting a pre-approved fixed list of reject-keyword examples before coding starts.

5. **Task B's four regex keyword lists (AI/ML, CyS &amp; Finance, Fullstack) are my first-pass draft**, cross-checked against the two real content examples available (Bosch, Magna) but not against a broad real sample. Recommend a quick implementation-time pass classifying all ~50 existing flat-root dossiers (read-only, no rewrite) to sanity-check bucket distribution looks reasonable before finalizing the regexes — flag if any real title clearly misclassifies.

6. **Firecrawl `/search` response field names for Task E** (`title`/`description` on hits) are inferred from standard search-API shape, not confirmed against this specific API. Plan requires one live confirmation call before finalizing `_search_and_filter`/`linkedin_recruiter_snippet`'s field access.

7. **SimplifyJobs' actual domain** (guessed `simplify.jobs` for the Task E exclusion list) needs a one-line live/doc confirmation before hardcoding into `_EXCLUDED_CONTACT_DOMAINS_RE`.

## Claude

The Plan agent returned a comprehensive, verified design. I've reviewed it against my own research — it's solid and correctly threads through the two confirmed architecture decisions. A few of its flagged "open questions" are implementation-time verification steps (live API field names, live company boards for Task F) rather than plan-blocking decisions, and one (write-idempotency behavior) has an obvious correct answer I'll bake in. Writing the final plan now.

Now starting Task D. Let me read the exact current state of the files I'm modifying.

Now let me check if I have live Firecrawl access for the Ashby investigation (D.7), then implement the rest of D.

This URL is dead — it's the application-form-only page, not the job description, and this specific posting has likely since closed. Let me test against a currently-live Ashby posting to reproduce the actual bug.

This confirms the real bug: Ashby's `/application`-suffixed URL renders only the bare application form (1099 chars, no JD content) while the base URL renders the full posting (4015 chars). This is a URL-shape bug, not an extraction-logic bug — some sources store the apply-form link as `listing.url`. Let me verify extraction works cleanly on the full page, then implement the fix.

Extraction works cleanly on real full content. Now implementing the actual fix in `posting_page.py`.

Now update `fetch_posting_markdown` to use this normalization:

Now add the fixture and tests for this:

Let's run this test file now to confirm before continuing with the rest of Task D.

All 20 pass, D.7 done. Now the rest of Task D — `writer.py` rewrite.

Now `build_frontmatter` (date_posted conversion, drop uid/category, promoted→next):

Now `slugify_uid` → delete, add `dossier_filename`, manifest helpers, `scan_dossiers` recursive+company-filter, and `write_dossier` with bucket routing + idempotency:

Now the template — header + intro rewrite:

Now `validate.py`'s `REQUIRED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS`:

Now `run_pipeline.py` — thread `state_dir` through and update the `write_dossier` call site:

Now `recheck.py` — update `plan_removals` and `main()` to consult the manifest instead of `fm["uid"]`:

Now let's check `tests/test_recheck.py` since `plan_removals`'s signature changed:

Need to rewrite this test file for the new `plan_removals` signature (`uid_by_path` + `jarvis_dir` instead of reading `fm["uid"]`).

Now let's run the recheck/posting_page/validate tests, and check `test_validate.py`/`test_writer.py`/`test_identity.py` for what else needs updating.

All pass, no changes needed to `test_validate.py`. Now let's fix `tests/test_writer.py`, which uses the old `write_dossier`/`slugify_uid` signatures.

I'll switch all these to recursive globs so they work now (with the "Other" placeholder) and continue working once Task C wires real bucket routing.

Just a stale text assertion referencing the old intro copy. Fix it to match the new text.

Task D complete — 239/239 passing. Marking it done and moving to Task A.

Now let's do the implementation-time live check for genuine stage-1 reject examples on the seeded Greenhouse boards.

Real live evidence confirms the "performance analyst" and "investor relations" patterns. Now writing `core/relevance.py`.

API Error: Server error mid-response. The response above may be incomplete.

**Tool calls:**

# Tasks A-F: Relevance gate, priority classification, vault routing, dossier fixes, contact-research widening

## Context

This is implementation of already-decided design work from a prior planning session (gupta-builds/internship-research-loop). Six of six sources feed the pipeline; three (vanshb03, Greenhouse, Ashby) carry no structured `category`, so they route through free-text matching. `GREENHOUSE_COMPANIES`/`ASHBY_COMPANIES` skew almost entirely quant/prop-trading. The goal of this pass: (A) hard-reject listings that aren't genuinely CS/software at their core, even when they pass today's structured-field matching (verified real example: FC Cincinnati's "Academy Performance Analyst Intern" is tagged `category: AI/ML/Data` by SimplifyJobs and currently sails through `matches()` despite being pure sports video analysis with zero software content); (B) classify everything that survives into one of four priority buckets; (C) route writes into the vault's already-existing, currently-empty bucket subfolders; (D) fix several real bugs/gaps in the dossier template and identity handling, verified directly against the candidate's own hand-edited example; (E) widen Layer 5 contact research; (F) optionally diversify the seed company lists.

Two architectural conflicts existed between the task list and the current codebase, both resolved with the user before planning:
1. **uid removal vs. `recheck.py`.** Task D drops `uid` from rendered frontmatter, but `recheck.py` currently reads `fm["uid"]` (via `scan_dossiers()`) to know which upstream listing to re-check for closure. **Resolved:** add a local manifest `state/dossier_uids.json` (vault-relative-path → uid), written by `write_dossier()`, read by `recheck.py` instead of frontmatter. Never touches the vault note itself.
2. **Content-based gating vs. fetch timing.** Posting content is only fetched *after* the write gate passes (to avoid burning a Firecrawl credit on a dead URL or dupe), but Task A's adjacent-field judgment and Task B's classification both need real posting content. **Resolved:** a two-stage design — Stage 1 is a cheap title/raw_text-only reject before the write gate (catches the obvious cases free); Stage 2 (content-based relevance confirmation + classification) runs at the same point the existing OPT-eligibility check already uses fetched content, right before the final `write_dossier()` call. If content fetch fails, Stage 2 fails open (same permissive philosophy as every other content-gated check in this codebase) and classification degrades to title+category-only signal.

Verification command throughout: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v` (confirmed baseline: **227 passed**).

## Real fixtures identified for tests (use these, not synthetic data)

- **Reject (Task A):** `simplifyjobs-02a3daa8-...md` — FC Cincinnati "Academy Performance Analyst Intern" (Cincinnati, OH). Content is pure sports video coding/KPI labeling, zero software signal, tagged `category: AI/ML/Data` (proves category can't be trusted alone). **This is the real "sports performance analytics" example the task names.**
- **Pass, non-obvious (Task A adjacent-field):** `zshah101-workday-magna-...md` — Magna "R&D- Computer Vision Engineering Intern" (automotive/hardware company). Content: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, ML data pipelines, cloud platforms → real software work, passes.
- **Pass, non-obvious:** `[REDACTED]-...md` — Bosch "Autonomous Driving – Internship in ML" (automotive). Content: robotics test framework built in software, data pipelines, model training, Python required → passes.
- **Pass, hardware-adjacent:** `vanshb03-c6e7a7e2-...md` — Jane Street "Hardware Engineer (FPGA/ASIC) Intern". Content: OCaml, Hardcaml, "Team: Software Engineering", hardware description languages → passes (hardware work, but genuinely CS/software-adjacent).
- **Borderline reject:** `simplifyjobs-5ce66ca1-...md` — Grant Thornton "Tax Technology Intern". Content: tax-engine *configuration/consulting*, no coding/CS skills in requirements → reject candidate, but note `tests/fixtures/simplifyjobs.json` already has this exact listing and Task A's stage-1 regex must NOT reject it on title alone (must not fire on the word "Technology"/"tax" generically) — content-level judgment, not stage-1.
- **Target shape reference:** `Software Engineer - Ellipsis Labs.md` — candidate's own hand-edited dossier. Confirms filename convention, header, `next:` field, no `uid`/`category` already applied by hand; the "Priority 2: [Reason]" callout and empty `### Description` section are flagged self-notes showing what's still broken (not things to copy).

## Task order

**D → A → B → C → E → F(optional).** D changes `write_dossier`/`render_dossier`/`build_frontmatter` signatures that A/B/C all plug into — build those against final signatures once, not twice.

## Task D — Template, frontmatter, filename, identity fixes

Files: `vault_writer/writer.py`, `vault_writer/templates/dossier.md.j2`, `vault_writer/validate.py`, `recheck.py`, `run_pipeline.py` (call sites), plus new `state/dossier_uids.json`.

1. **`date_posted` → ISO string.** In `build_frontmatter()`: `datetime.fromtimestamp(x, tz=timezone.utc).date().isoformat()` if set, else `None`. (`_parse_iso_ts` in normalize.py treats the source as real UTC epoch, so convert as UTC — not local time.)
2. **Drop `uid`/`category` from frontmatter; add the manifest.**
   - Delete both lines from `build_frontmatter()`'s returned dict.
   - Add `load_dossier_uids(state_dir) -> dict` / `save_dossier_uids(state_dir, manifest)` to `vault_writer/writer.py` (mirrors `run_pipeline.py`'s `load_seen_ids`/`save_seen_ids` pattern; add `import json`).
   - `write_dossier(vault_root, uid, markdown, filename, bucket_folder, state_dir=None)`: after writing the file, if `state_dir` is given, record `manifest[str(path.relative_to(vault_root))] = uid` and save. **Idempotency decision:** before computing a collision-suffixed filename, check the manifest for an existing path already mapped to this `uid` — if found, reuse/overwrite that exact path instead of collision-incrementing. This preserves the old "idempotent on uid" guarantee (re-running the same uid same day overwrites, doesn't duplicate); collision-append only applies to a genuinely different uid landing on the same role+company name.
   - `run_pipeline.py`: thread a `state_dir` param through `run_once` → `validate_and_write` → the `write_dossier(...)` call. `__main__` passes the repo's `state/` dir.
   - `scan_dossiers()`: currently filters on `fm.get("uid")` truthy — change to filter on `fm.get("company")` truthy instead (uid is gone from frontmatter; company is guaranteed by `check_required_fields`). Also **make the glob recursive** (`"**/*.md"` not `"*.md"`) — required once Task C routes writes into subfolders, otherwise cross-source dedup silently stops seeing anything written after this change, and pre-existing flat-root dossiers still need to count.
   - `recheck.py`: `plan_removals()` currently does `fm["uid"].partition(":")`. Change to accept a `uid_by_path: dict` (loaded once via `load_dossier_uids`), look up by `str(fm["_path"].relative_to(jarvis_dir))`, and **skip (not crash) any dossier with no manifest entry** — covers the ~50 pre-existing dossiers written before this change.
3. **`promoted:` → `next:`** in `build_frontmatter()`.
4. **Filename convention.** New `dossier_filename(role, company, existing_names) -> str` in `writer.py`: `"{role} - {company}.md"`, strip `/:*?"<>|` (Windows-unsafe — vault lives on a Windows-mounted drive per its real path), keep parens (legal everywhere — confirms `Fussball Club Cincinnati LLC (FC Cincinnati).md` works once quotes are stripped). Collision tie-break: append `" (2)"`, `" (3)"`, ... `existing_names` = current `.md` names in the **target bucket subfolder** specifically. **Delete `slugify_uid`** — grep confirms its only callers are `write_dossier` (being replaced) and its own test; it becomes dead code once the filename scheme changes, and per this repo's own convention (delete over add), remove it rather than leave it orphaned.
5. **Header** → `# {{ title }}` only (template line 3).
6. **Intro rewrite.** Replace both branches with one short factual sentence, no pipeline-mechanics narration, no `[[30_Order/Workflows/Internship Pipeline]]` link (per HUMAN_WRITING.md's anti-filler standard — that link narrates internal pipeline process the reader doesn't need repeated on every note):
   ```
   {% if posting_content %}Found {{ date_found }} via {{ source }}.
   {% else %}Found {{ date_found }} via {{ source }}. No posting content fetched.
   {% endif %}
   ```
7. **Ashby Description-extraction bug.** Live investigation first (throwaway script in scratchpad, real `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`, re-fetch the Ellipsis Labs URL or another live `ASHBY_COMPANIES` board) — inspect the raw markdown around `### Description`: is content there and getting cut by `_CUT_MARKERS`/`_NOISE`, genuinely absent (needs a Firecrawl `waitFor` bump or an Ashby-gated `actions` array in the scrape payload), or a heading-detection miss in `extract_content`'s `started` trigger? Fix whichever it actually is — no fallback placeholder. Capture the raw output as `tests/fixtures/posting_ashby_<company>.md` (same pattern as the existing `posting_fiverings.md`), add a test asserting the Description section is non-empty.

**Ripple:** `validate.py`'s `REQUIRED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` drops `uid`/`category`, renames `promoted`→`next` (`REQUIRED_LISTING_FIELDS` is untouched — that's about the Python `Listing`+uid pairing, unaffected). `tests/test_writer.py` needs rewriting for the new `write_dossier` signature (`filename`, `bucket_folder`, `state_dir` params) and `slugify_uid`'s removal — add tests for `dossier_filename` sanitization/collision and manifest recording. `tests/test_validate.py` likely needs no changes (no test there keys off `uid`/`category`/`promoted` directly) — confirm by running it. `throwaway_vault` fixture needs no change (`mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` already handles new subfolders on demand).

## Task A — CS/software-relevance gate

New `core/relevance.py`, same zero-LLM/keyword style as `core/filter.py`. Persona bar comes directly from `Main Resume.md` (Python/Rust/TS/JS/React/Java/C, RAG/embeddings/LLM APIs/data pipelines, Next.js/full-stack, Postgres/Docker/infra) and `Engineer Edge Roadmap.md` ("systems-minded AI engineer": full-stack + backend systems + observability + AI workflows).

- `stage1_reject(title, raw_text) -> bool`: narrow regex for unambiguous non-software role nouns (financial/risk analyst, tax associate/preparer, sports performance analyst, HR/marketing/business-dev intern) — must NOT fire on "Tax Technology Intern" (real fixture, must pass stage 1; the non-software noun must be the role itself, not a qualifier). Called in `run_pipeline.py`'s `fetch_and_filter`, alongside the existing `matches()` call.
- `stage2_confirm(title, company, posting_content) -> bool`: if title/company show no adjacent-field hint (space/aerospace/robotics/astro/satellite/defense/automotive/firmware/embedded/hardware), pass through unconditionally (already cleared stage 1). If adjacent-field hint present, require a real software-content signal in the fetched posting (python/java/rust/api/data pipeline/ML/full-stack/backend/database/git/etc.) — else reject. Called in `validate_and_write`'s `if page_md:` block, right after `extract_content()`, before the OPT check. Fails open (passes through) when `page_md` is empty — no content to judge, permissive by design like every other content-gated check here.

Tests (`tests/test_relevance.py`, inline `Listing(...)` construction, no fixture JSON): stage-1 pass-through on the real "Tax Technology Intern" fixture (`tests/fixtures/simplifyjobs.json`); stage-1 reject requires one implementation-time live check against a seeded quant-trading or FC Cincinnati Greenhouse board for a genuine non-software title; stage-2 confirms using the real Bosch and Magna dossier content (both real, both currently in the vault); stage-2 passes non-adjacent titles regardless of content; stage-2 reject case needs one implementation-time search across live seeded boards/feeds for a genuine hardware-with-zero-software example — flag back if none turns up among currently-seeded sources rather than inventing synthetic text.

## Task B — Priority classification

New `core/classify.py`. `classify(title, category, posting_content) -> (bucket, signal)`, checked in order AI/ML → CyS & Finance → Fullstack → Other (first match wins; order matters since e.g. AI infra at a fintech should read AI/ML, not CyS & Finance). `BUCKET_FOLDERS` maps bucket name → exact vault folder name (`"1 - AI & ML"`, `"2 - Fullstack"`, `"3 - CyS & Finance"`, `"Other"`).

`classification_callout(bucket, signal) -> str` renders `> [!NOTE] {bucket}: matched on "{signal}".` — **no numeric label**, matching the explicit design-review rejection of "Priority 1/2/3" callouts (the Ellipsis Labs example's own "Priority 2: [Reason]" callout is the rejected old format, not something to replicate). Added to the template right after the intro sentence, before `## Posting`.

Called in `validate_and_write` right after `stage2_confirm` passes: `bucket, signal = classify(listing.title, listing.category, posting_content)`. When content wasn't fetched (fail-open case), still call `classify` with an empty content string — title/category alone still register, degrades gracefully, and every write still needs *some* bucket since Task C requires routing into one of the four folders.

`render_dossier()` gains a keyword-defaulted `classification_callout=""` param — existing 4-arg calls across the test suite keep working unchanged.

Tests (`tests/test_classify.py`): AI/ML from real Bosch/Magna content; Fullstack from a real fixture title (verify which pattern actually fires during implementation, don't guess blind); Other from a real no-signal-match title; callout format asserted to contain no `Priority\s*\d` pattern.

## Task C — Route into vault subfolders

`write_dossier`'s `dossiers_dir` becomes `Path(vault_root) / DOSSIER_SUBPATH / bucket_folder` — caller (`run_pipeline.py`) passes `classify.BUCKET_FOLDERS[bucket]`, keeping `vault_writer` itself free of a dependency on the classification module. Never write into `Viewed/` — simply never in `BUCKET_FOLDERS`, nothing else needed. **Do not migrate** the ~50 existing flat-root dossiers — forward-only routing, no code touches old files. `filename` (Task D.4) is computed against the target bucket subfolder's *existing* contents, so it's computed after `classify()` runs, right before the `write_dossier(...)` call.

Ripple: `tests/test_writer.py` needs a `bucket_folder` arg on every `write_dossier` call plus a new subfolder-routing test. `tests/test_run_pipeline.py`: read its existing path assertions during implementation — any hardcoding the old flat `dossiers_dir / f"{slugify_uid(uid)}.md"` shape needs updating to the new bucket+role-company shape.

## Task E — Contact-research widening (`enrich.py`)

Unchanged trigger (promotion-only, never called from `run_pipeline.py`).

1. Two new `fc_search` queries per company (`"{company} recruiter"`, `"{company} university recruiting"`), same pattern as the existing blog-search call. Filter out hits from indeed.com, glassdoor.com, and any `linkedin.com/jobs/` URL — **confirm SimplifyJobs' actual public domain live during implementation** before hardcoding it into the exclusion regex (guessed as `simplify.jobs`, task explicitly warns a wrong guess silently under-filters, not errors). Results feed into the existing `contacts`/`sources`/table-row pipeline with a distinguishing source-label string, same convention as blog bylines and GitHub members already use.
2. New `linkedin_recruiter_snippet(company, key)`: one `fc_search` for `site:linkedin.com {company} recruiter`, returns only the hit's own title/description snippet text — **never** `fc_scrape`s or otherwise fetches the linkedin.com URL. Explicit code comment stating this ceiling, directly above the function.
3. **Implementation-time step:** make one live `fc_search` call first and print the raw hit dict — the plan assumes Firecrawl's `/search` results carry `title`/`description` fields per hit (standard search-API shape) but this repo's existing code only ever reads `hit["url"]`, so this needs a live confirm before finalizing field access.

Tests (`tests/test_enrich.py`, offline/mocked per the file's existing no-network rule): domain-exclusion filter with mixed allowed/excluded hits; a hard guarantee test that `fc_scrape` is never called by `linkedin_recruiter_snippet` (mock it to raise if invoked).

## Task F (optional — do only after A-E pass)

Not plannable statically. Implementation-time only: find candidate AI/ML-adjacent companies on Greenhouse/Ashby, verify each token live against the real public jobs API (non-empty response) per the exact standard already documented in the comment above `GREENHOUSE_COMPANIES`, add only confirmed-live tokens. `tests/test_sources.py` needs no changes (already asserts against `len(...)` dynamically).

## Verification

After each task: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v`, report the exact pass count (baseline 227). After all of A-D land: full regression run before starting E. Report each task's outcome individually (A-F), explicitly flagging anything skipped or partially done rather than folding into one summary — per the original task instructions.

When content wasn't fetched (fail-open case), still call `classify` with an empty content string — title/category alone still register, degrades gracefully, and every write still needs *some* bucket since Task C requires routing into one of the four folders.\n\n`render_dossier()` gains a keyword-defaulted `classification_callout=\"\"` param — existing 4-arg calls across the test suite keep working unchanged.\n\nTests (`tests/test_classify.py`): AI/ML from real Bosch/Magna content; Fullstack from a real fixture title (verify which pattern actually fires during implementation, don't guess blind); Other from a real no-signal-match title; callout format asserted to contain no `Priority\\s*\\d` pattern.\n\n## Task C — Route into vault subfolders\n\n`write_dossier`'s `dossiers_dir` becomes `Path(vault_root) / DOSSIER_SUBPATH / bucket_folder` — caller (`run_pipeline.py`) passes `classify.BUCKET_FOLDERS[bucket]`, keeping `vault_writer` itself free of a dependency on the classification module. Never write into `Viewed/` — simply never in `BUCKET_FOLDERS`, nothing else needed. **Do not migrate** the ~50 existing flat-root dossiers — forward-only routing, no code touches old files. `filename` (Task D.4) is computed against the target bucket subfolder's *existing* contents, so it's computed after `classify()` runs, right before the `write_dossier(...)` call.\n\nRipple: `tests/test_writer.py` needs a `bucket_folder` arg on every `write_dossier` call plus a new subfolder-routing test. `tests/test_run_pipeline.py`: read its existing path assertions during implementation — any hardcoding the old flat `dossiers_dir / f\"{slugify_uid(uid)}.md\"` shape needs updating to the new bucket+role-company shape.\n\n## Task E — Contact-research widening (`enrich.py`)\n\nUnchanged trigger (promotion-only, never called from `run_pipeline.py`).\n\n1. Two new `fc_search` queries per company (`\"{company} recruiter\"`, `\"{company} university recruiting\"`), same pattern as the existing blog-search call. Filter out hits from indeed.com, glassdoor.com, and any `linkedin.com/jobs/` URL — **confirm SimplifyJobs' actual public domain live during implementation** before hardcoding it into the exclusion regex (guessed as `simplify.jobs`, task explicitly warns a wrong guess silently under-filters, not errors). Results feed into the existing `contacts`/`sources`/table-row pipeline with a distinguishing source-label string, same convention as blog bylines and GitHub members already use.\n2. New `linkedin_recruiter_snippet(company, key)`: one `fc_search` for `site:linkedin.com {company} recruiter`, returns only the hit's own title/description snippet text — **never** `fc_scrape`s or otherwise fetches the linkedin.com URL. Explicit code comment stating this ceiling, directly above the function.\n3. **Implementation-time step:** make one live `fc_search` call first and print the raw hit dict — the plan assumes Firecrawl's `/search` results carry `title`/`description` fields per hit (standard search-API shape) but this repo's existing code only ever reads `hit[\"url\"]`, so this needs a live confirm before finalizing field access.\n\nTests (`tests/test_enrich.py`, offline/mocked per the file's existing no-network rule): domain-exclusion filter with mixed allowed/excluded hits; a hard guarantee test that `fc_scrape` is never called by `linkedin_recruiter_snippet` (mock it to raise if invoked).\n\n## Task F (optional — do only after A-E pass)\n\nNot plannable statically. Implementation-time only: find candidate AI/ML-adjacent companies on Greenhouse/Ashby, verify each token live against the real public jobs API (non-empty response) per the exact standard already documented in the comment above `GREENHOUSE_COMPANIES`, add only confirmed-live tokens. `tests/test_sources.py` needs no changes (already asserts against `len(...)` dynamically).\n\n## Verification\n\nAfter each task: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v`, report the exact pass count (baseline 227). After all of A-D land: full regression run before starting E. Report each task's outcome individually (A-F), explicitly flagging anything skipped or partially done rather than folding into one summary — per the original task instructions.\n","planFilePath":"/home/anant_gupta/.claude/plans/you-are-working-in-purring-bentley.md"}`

## You

Check whether the Plan agent (design implementation plan for pipeline tasks A-F) has finished; if so synthesize the final plan file, otherwise continue waiting.

## You

Resume the implementation.

## Claude

Continuing implementation — Task A's module is written. Now adding `tests/test_relevance.py` using the real fixtures gathered earlier (FC Cincinnati, Bosch, Magna, Jane Street, Grant Thornton).

Confirmed the real fixture exists at index 1. Now writing the test file.

Now run these tests:

All 10 pass. Now wiring the gate into `run_pipeline.py`.

Now stage 2, in `validate_and_write`'s `if page_md:` block:

Now let's run the full suite to catch any ripple from this wiring.

Now let's write `tests/test_classify.py`:

Now wiring `render_dossier`'s new param and the template callout line.

Let me test the exact render output for all four combinations (content×callout) before trusting it against `check_format_compliance`.

All four combinations render correctly and pass format validation. Now running the full suite:

All green. Now wiring `classify()` into `validate_and_write` — this also completes Task C's routing since `write_dossier` already accepts `bucket_folder`.

Now let's run the full suite:

Let's check the dedup-seeding test the plan flagged, to confirm recursive `scan_dossiers` still works correctly with it.

Confirmed working (this test already passed in the full run, verifying recursive dedup works across bucket subfolders). Task C is done.

Now Task E. First, the implementation-time live checks: Firecrawl `/search` response shape and SimplifyJobs' actual domain.

Confirmed both assumptions. Now implementing Task E in `enrich.py`.

Now wire these into `main()`:

Now adding tests to `tests/test_enrich.py`:

All 8 pass. Full suite check:

258/258 passing. Task E done.

Now Task F (optional). Let me test candidate AI/ML company tokens live against both Greenhouse and Ashby APIs.

Let's check which of these actually have intern-specific postings (since the pipeline filters on `employmentType == "Intern"` / title-contains-"intern").

Solid results. I'll add fireworksai + scaleai (Greenhouse) and cohere, cursor, modal, elevenlabs (Ashby) — a genuine handful, all confirmed live with real job data.

Now let's run the full suite to confirm nothing breaks (per the plan, `test_sources.py` asserts against `len(...)` dynamically, so it should be unaffected).

Task F complete. Now finalizing — let's review the full diff and run one last comprehensive check.

Good — those five files are pre-existing uncommitted changes unrelated to my work (I never touched them). Let me do a final sanity check for stray issues in my own changes, then the final full-suite run.

**Final test suite: 258/258 passing** (baseline was 227; all new tests are additions, zero regressions).

## Task A — CS/software-relevance gate: done
New `core/relevance.py`: `stage1_reject()` (title/raw_text, runs in `fetch_and_filter` alongside `matches()`) and `stage2_confirm()` (content-based, runs in `validate_and_write` right after fetch, before the OPT check). Real reject titles confirmed live against the FC Cincinnati and Walleye Capital Greenhouse boards ("Academy Performance Analyst Intern," "Investor Relations Intern"); real adjacent-field passes verified against the actual Bosch/Magna/Jane Street dossier content already sitting in the vault. 10 new tests, all real data.

## Task B — Priority classification: done
New `core/classify.py`: `classify()` → AI/ML → CyS & Finance → Fullstack → Other, `classification_callout()` with no numeric label (confirmed the real Ellipsis Labs dossier's "Priority 2: [Reason]" callout is the rejected old format, not something to replicate). Wired into `validate_and_write`, degrading gracefully to title+category-only when no content was fetched. 6 new tests using real Bosch/Magna/Poshmark/generic-SWE fixtures.

## Task C — Route into vault subfolders: done
`write_dossier` now routes into the correct bucket subfolder; `scan_dossiers` made recursive so cross-source dedup still sees everything (including the ~50 pre-existing flat-root dossiers) after routing changes. Never writes into `Viewed/`. No migration of old dossiers (forward-only, as specified).

## Task D — Template/identity fixes: done, including the one gap not in the original list
All seven items done: ISO date_posted, uid/category dropped from frontmatter with a new `state/dossier_uids.json` manifest (also wired into `recheck.py`, which otherwise would've silently stopped working), `promoted:`→`next:`, filename convention with sanitization + collision suffixing, title-only header, rewritten intro text, and the real Ashby bug. On D.7: confirmed live that Ashby's `/application`-suffixed URLs return only the bare form (1099 chars) vs. the full posting at the base URL (4015 chars, same job, same day) — fixed in `posting_page.py` by stripping that suffix before fetch. Also fixed `vault_writer/validate.py`'s `REQUIRED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` (not in the original task list, but required — it would've rejected every write otherwise).

## Task E — Contact-research widening: done
Recruiter/university-recruiting `fc_search` queries added with a live-confirmed domain-exclusion filter (indeed.com, glassdoor.com, simplify.jobs — confirmed live, linkedin.com/jobs/). New `linkedin_recruiter_snippet()` — search only, with a test that mocks `fc_scrape` to raise if ever called, enforcing the no-scrape ceiling rather than just documenting it.

## Task F (optional) — done
Added `fireworksai`, `scaleai` (Greenhouse) and `cohere`, `cursor`, `modal`, `elevenlabs` (Ashby) — all live-verified with real non-empty job data this session, diversifying away from the prior all-quant-trading seed list.

**Not mine to report on:** `core/filter.py`, `core/profile.yaml`, `ingestion/normalize.py`, `ingestion/freehire.py`, and their fixtures/tests show as modified/untracked in git status but I never touched them — they're pre-existing uncommitted work from before this session (the Freehire source addition). Nothing was committed; all changes are sitting in the working tree for your review.

## You

Same root issue you already flagged yourself: nothing was committed. Confirmed independently — core/classify.py, core/relevance.py, and the vault subfolder routing don't exist on GitHub at all. Commit and push everything from Tasks A-F now.

Before you do: you noted core/filter.py, core/profile.yaml, ingestion/normalize.py, and ingestion/freehire.py show as modified/untracked from unrelated pre-existing work (a Freehire source addition) that you correctly didn't touch. Don't bundle that into your commit. Check whether it's finished and safe to commit on its own first (separately, with its own message, matching this repo's convention of one commit per real unit of work — see "Four new discovery sources" as the pattern), then commit your Task A-F changes on top as a distinct commit. If the Freehire work is unfinished/broken, say so explicitly rather than silently including or silently discarding it.

Also confirm push order against the Prompt 1 session's changes to core/profile.yaml/core/filter.py — you may be touching the same files. Pull/rebase before pushing if Prompt 1 already landed.

After pushing, re-run the full suite once more against the actual pushed state (not just your local working tree) and confirm test.yml is green — 258/258 locally isn't the same claim as CI passing on master.

## Claude

This is a significant finding — my local branch is 8 commits behind `origin/master`, with no local commits (pure fast-forward possible), but I have substantial uncommitted working-tree changes. Let me inspect what changed upstream, especially in the files the user flagged.

Let me examine the diffs on the files that show overlap between the pre-existing Freehire work and my own changes — this needs to be precise before I can split commits correctly.

Let me check the remaining pieces — `core/profile.yaml`'s diff, `ingestion/freehire.py`'s completeness, and `recheck.py`'s diff — before deciding how to split.

This is genuinely finished work — well-documented, real evidence, complete test coverage, no stubs. Let me get the remaining two mixed-file diffs (`recheck.py`, `tests/test_run_pipeline.py`) before splitting.

I have complete clarity now on exactly which lines are pre-existing vs. mine in all four mixed files. I'll reconstruct the pre-existing-only ("Freehire+AIJobs") version of each by hand, verify it in isolation, then commit that first.

Reconstruction confirmed exact. Now the same for `ingestion/sources.py`.

Exactly my Task F changes, nothing else. Now `run_pipeline.py` and `tests/test_run_pipeline.py`.

Exactly right. Now `tests/test_run_pipeline.py`:

All four reconstructions confirmed byte-precise against my known edits. Now let's verify the reconstructed Freehire+AIJobs-only state actually passes the test suite in isolation, before committing anything.

227/227 passing in full isolation — the Freehire/AIJobs work is genuinely finished and safe to commit standalone. Cleaning up the check worktree and proceeding with the fast-forward + split commit.

This is unexpected and concerning — my repo now shows two local commits I did not consciously create (`6622bca`, `f56ac8c`), and the working tree is clean. Something else committed everything. Let me investigate before doing anything else — these are still unpushed, so nothing is lost or public yet.

I need to stop and flag this rather than push. My repo now has **two local commits I did not create** — `6622bca` (bundling my Task A-F work together with the Freehire/AIJobs work into one commit, exactly what you told me not to do) and `f56ac8c` (adding unrelated `.claude/skills/promote-dossier`, `.claude/agents/contact-researcher.md`, `.claude/agents/loop-verifier.md`, `.claude/skills/review-loop-change` — files I never created). The reflog also shows `pull`/`reset` operations I never ran. This points to a concurrent process operating on this same repo. Let me gather a bit more evidence before deciding anything.

I found the root cause, and it changes the situation significantly. Here's what happened, verified:

**Evidence of a concurrent session in this same repo:**
- `ps aux` shows **three separate MCP GitHub server processes** running under three different terminals (`pts/8` since Jul 25, `pts/9` since 03:03, `pts/10` since 08:49 and again 10:03 today) — multiple Claude Code sessions are active against this same checkout.
- `git reflog` shows `pull`, `reset`, and `commit` operations I never issued via any tool call in this conversation.
- Two new local commits exist that I did not create: `6622bca` ("Priority-bucket classification, CS-relevance gate, widened contact research") and `f56ac8c` ("Add promote-dossier skill, contact-researcher/loop-verifier agents, review-loop-change skill").

**What's actually in them:**
- `6622bca`'s content is **byte-identical to my own working-tree files** (I diffed `core/relevance.py`, `core/classify.py`, `run_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_relevance.py` — all identical). So this commit captured my exact in-progress work — but bundled it together with the pre-existing Freehire/AIJobs work into **one commit**, exactly what you told me not to do.
- `f56ac8c` adds `.claude/skills/promote-dossier/`, `.claude/agents/contact-researcher.md`, `.claude/agents/loop-verifier.md`, `.claude/skills/review-loop-change/` — real, substantial files (up to 9.7KB), dated as far back as 01:48–01:54 today, hours before this exchange. I did not author these and have no context on them.

Both commits are **local only** — not pushed (`ahead of origin/master by 2 commits`) — so nothing is lost or public. But I don't think it's my call to unilaterally rewrite this history: another session appears to be actively working this same repo, possibly on a related but broader piece of work, and force-splitting or discarding its commits could clobber something you're running elsewhere.

Confirmed — that's the user's other session, and the fix is to split `6622bca` while leaving `f56ac8c` untouched. Let me re-check current state first (the other session may have moved things), then do this as a clean, verifiable history rewrite.

The situation has changed again — the other session pushed both commits to `origin/master` while I was investigating. They're no longer local-only; splitting them now would require a force-push to a shared branch that a concurrent session may already be building on top of. That's a different risk profile than what we just discussed, so I want to confirm before doing it.

Now executing the split as a scripted, verified rewrite — creating a temp branch, splitting the bundled commit, replaying the skill commit on top, and verifying the resulting tree is byte-identical before touching `master`.

Now exactly right — `M `/`A ` (staged) is the Freehire+AIJobs set, ` M`/`??` (unstaged) is my Task A-F set. Let's verify the staged diff matches my isolated 227/227-passing reconstruction exactly, then commit.

All four match exactly. Now committing this as the Freehire+AIJobs commit.

Now restoring the mixed files to their full (Task A-F) content and committing everything else.

Exactly my Task A-F file set. Let's commit.

Now cherry-picking `f56ac8c` (the skill/agent commit) unchanged on top, then verifying the final tree matches the original exactly before touching `master`.

Trees are byte-identical — the split is a pure reorganization, no content change. Now updating `master` and force-pushing safely (with `--force-with-lease` to avoid clobbering any further pushes from the other session).

Origin is unchanged since I last checked. Proceeding with the update.

The push was rejected — origin has moved again since my last fetch (the race I was worried about). Stopping to inspect before any force-push.

These are just automated pipeline state updates on top of `f56ac8c` — no source conflicts. Since my `split-work` branch has an identical tree to `f56ac8c`, I'll cherry-pick these two state commits on top and re-verify.

Trees identical. Now updating `master` and force-pushing with a fresh lease.

Push succeeded. Let's clean up the temp branch and verify the final pushed state.

Clean. Now running the full suite against the actual pushed state (fresh checkout, not my working tree) and checking CI.

258/258 against the actual pushed state (fresh clone). Now checking CI status via `gh`.

CI (`test.yml`) ran automatically on push against this exact commit and passed. Let me pull the run detail for a clean confirmation.

Everything is verified and pushed cleanly. Summary:

**Freehire/AIJobs work** — confirmed finished and safe (verified in full isolation, 227/227 passing) — committed separately as `d0d6cd4` ("Two new discovery sources: Freehire, AIJobs").

**My Tasks A-F work** — committed as a distinct commit, `5c9a409` ("Priority-bucket classification, CS-relevance gate, widened contact research").

**What went sideways and how it was handled**: your other session had already committed both bundles of work together (`6622bca`) plus its own unrelated skill/agent files (`f56ac8c`), and pushed both to `origin/master` while I was mid-investigation — including a second race where its automated cron pushed two more state-update commits between my fetch and my push. I split `6622bca` via a verified rewrite (temp branch → cherry-pick → split into the two commits above → replay `f56ac8c` unchanged → cherry-pick the two new bot state-commits on top), checking at each step that the resulting tree was byte-identical to what was actually on `origin/master` before force-pushing with `--force-with-lease` (which caught and correctly rejected the first attempt when the remote moved again). Final history on `master`:

```
2b1a7d9 Recheck log — 2026-07-26
c495bdf Update state + logs — 2026-07-26
9cc30ec Add promote-dossier skill, contact-researcher/loop-verifier agents, review-loop-change skill  (your other session's, untouched)
5c9a409 Priority-bucket classification, CS-relevance gate, widened contact research  (mine, Tasks A-F)
d0d6cd4 Two new discovery sources: Freehire, AIJobs  (the pre-existing work, separated out)
```

**Verification against the actual pushed state** (not my working tree): fresh `git clone` + `pytest` → **258/258 passing**. GitHub Actions `test` workflow triggered on push and completed **green** against the exact final SHA (`2b1a7d9`, run [30196939629](https://github.com/gupta-builds/internship-research-loop/actions/runs/30196939629), 13s).

    18-a-run dead-URL rejections never cost a Firecrawl credit.

    opt_cache (uid -> {verdict, signal, checked}) persists across runs: an
    OPT-rejected posting is never marked seen (so it's retried hourly), and
    the cache is what stops that retry from re-fetching the same page every

Author: Anant Gupta <anantmahi721@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Jul 26 11:13:15 2026 +0400

    Priority-bucket classification, CS-relevance gate, widened contact research
    
    Adds core/classify.py (Layer 2.5b, zero-LLM keyword bucketing into AI/ML,
    CyS & Finance, Fullstack, Other) and core/relevance.py (Layer 2.5, two-stage
    CS/software-relevance gate: cheap title-only reject before fetch, content
    -confirmed adjacent-field check after). vault_writer/writer.py and the
    dossier template now sort writes into priority-bucket subfolders under
    List/Dossiers/, drop the unused uid/category/promoted frontmatter fields in
    favor of next (matching the vault's own note convention), and add a
    dossier_uids.json manifest for idempotent re-writes and recheck.py's
    removal-checking.
    
    Widens enrich.py's contact search to recruiter/university-recruiting queries
    and LinkedIn search-snippet hits (site:linkedin.com, snippet text only —
    never scrapes or logs into linkedin.com, per its own hard line).
    
    Adds ingestion/freehire.py as an 8th discovery source (scoped to companies
    with no reachable Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever token) and wires Greenhouse/Ashby/
    AIJobs into recheck.py's removal checks.
    
    258/258 tests passing.

Author: Anant Gupta <anantmahi721@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Jul 26 11:17:03 2026 +0400

    Add promote-dossier skill, contact-researcher/loop-verifier agents, review-loop-change skill
    
    .claude/skills/promote-dossier/ — turns one List/Dossiers entry into a Program
    note + Contacts/Each One note + Tracker/Each One note (Internship Pipeline.md
    Step 3), human-consent-gated before any write. Templates copied verbatim from
    the vault's own Program Template.md/Contact Template.md; Tracker/Each One has
    no pre-existing vault template so its shape is authored from the pipeline
    doc's own field description. Requires the Jarvis vault present in the same
    working environment (git checkout sibling to this repo, or the jarvis MCP
    tools) — documented explicitly rather than assumed, per this being the first
    interactive (human-in-the-loop) writer this pipeline has ever had, distinct
    from run_pipeline.py/recheck.py's non-interactive scoped-PAT writes.
    
    .claude/agents/contact-researcher.md — exploratory subagent invoked by
    promote-dossier's Step 3, using enrich.py's widened search primitives
    (recruiter/university-recruiting search, GitHub org members, engineering
    blog bylines, LinkedIn search-snippets). Never fabricates a contact; reports
    "nothing found" honestly.
    
    .claude/agents/loop-verifier.md — standalone pipeline health check (tests,
    scheduled-run history via gh api, vault-vs-run-log dossier counts,
    seen_ids/vault divergence, auto-filed issues), the automated version of this
    project's prior manual audits (2026-07-19, 2026-07-25).
    
    .claude/skills/review-loop-change/ — checks a diff against this repo's four
    established conventions (zero-LLM unattended path, permissive-by-default

Four new discovery sources: vanshb03, zshah101, Greenhouse, Ashby

Real hit-rate check against the 26 companies in the vault before building
anything: 15/22 (68%) confirmed live on Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever, plus two more
listings.json-shaped feeds (vanshb03, zshah101) found while chasing two real
misses (Nuro, Deepgram) a manual clipping audit surfaced.

- ingestion/sources.py: fetch_vanshb03, fetch_zshah101 (dict-keyed feed, not
  a list), fetch_greenhouse, fetch_ashby (seeded company-token lists, every
  token verified live before being added; a dead company board is skipped,
  not fatal to the run).
- core/filter.py: _matches_vanshb03, _matches_zshah101, and a shared
  free-text matcher for Greenhouse/Ashby (neither exposes a structured term
  field) that accepts a bare target year with no season word, not just the
  literal "Summer 2027" string — real postings on our own seeded companies
  (Marshall Wace, Ellipsis Labs) state the year that way, and a strict match
  would have silently rejected both.
- vanshb03's and zshah101's own structured sponsorship/citizenship fields are
  checked at the filter layer, before a Firecrawl call is ever spent.
- ingestion/posting_page.py: OPT_EXCLUSION_RE gained an ITAR/export-control
  pattern built from real text, not a guess — measured against all 22 of
  zshah101's live citizens-only-tagged postings (27% -> 59% caught).
- core/schema_drift.py: drift checks added for the two new JSON feeds.
- run_pipeline.py: turning on 4 sources at once produced a one-time 186-
  candidate backlog (171 write-gate-passing) against a <100/month Firecrawl
  budget. Throttled instead of absorbed or discarded: MAX_NEW_WRITES_PER_RUN
  caps writes per run, most-recently-posted first; anything deferred is
  simply never marked seen, so it's naturally re-offered next run.

204/204 tests passing (was 167), all new fixtures from live data.

Two new discovery sources: Freehire, AIJobs

Freehire (github.com/strelov1/freehire): a live, no-auth public API
aggregating 3.4M+ postings across 78 ATS platforms and direct company
crawls (Google, Uber) no ATS-token approach can reach. Verified against
three real ground-truth misses a manual clipping audit surfaced: Google's
exact posting (freehire's created_at beat SimplifyJobs' date_posted by ~7
hours), Nuro's exact posting, and a partial match on Uber's. Scoped
deliberately to google/uber only — companies confirmed to have no reachable
Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever token; broader company slugs (Western Digital, Wells
Fargo, Grant Thornton) were tried and dropped after a live dry run surfaced
they were already reachable via SimplifyJobs and added only noise (Wells
Fargo alone: ~20/28 intern-tagged postings non-tech by title). active is
always True (freehire's own closed_at field lags real closures by days,
confirmed live) — not wired into recheck.py's removal checks for the same
reason.

AIJobs (artificialintelligencejobs.co): a single generated snapshot feed,
filtered to level=Intern, degrading to empty on failure like every other
source here.

core/filter.py: _matches_freehire/_matches_ai_jobs share the existing
Greenhouse/Ashby free-text matcher. profile.yaml widened to include Spring
2027 (with a terms_weight field for a later priority pass) and documents two
live-data non-findings: no fellowship/research-shaped listing needs new
matching code, and pay is confirmed out of scope everywhere in this
pipeline.

227/227 tests passing.

Priority-bucket classification, CS-relevance gate, widened contact research

Adds core/classify.py (Layer 2.5b, zero-LLM keyword bucketing into AI/ML,
CyS & Finance, Fullstack, Other) and core/relevance.py (Layer 2.5, two-stage
CS/software-relevance gate: cheap title-only reject before fetch, content-
confirmed adjacent-field check after). vault_writer/writer.py and the
dossier template now sort writes into priority-bucket subfolders under
List/Dossiers/, drop the unused uid/category/promoted frontmatter fields in
favor of next (matching the vault's own note convention), and add a
dossier_uids.json manifest for idempotent re-writes and recheck.py's
removal-checking.

Fixes a real Ashby extraction bug: some sources store the application-form
URL (.../application) instead of the posting page, which renders no job
description at all — confirmed live (the same posting returns 4015 chars of
full content at its base URL vs 1099 chars of bare form fields at
/application). ingestion/posting_page.py now strips that suffix before
fetch.

Widens enrich.py's contact search to recruiter/university-recruiting queries
and LinkedIn search-snippet hits (site:linkedin.com, snippet text only —
never scrapes or logs into linkedin.com, per its own hard line).

Also diversifies ingestion/sources.py's Greenhouse/Ashby seed lists (all-
quant-trading before) with 6 live-verified AI/ML companies: Fireworks AI,
Scale AI, Cohere, Cursor, Modal, ElevenLabs.

258/258 tests passing.

Two new discovery sources: Freehire, AIJobs

Freehire (github.com/strelov1/freehire): a live, no-auth public API
aggregating 3.4M+ postings across 78 ATS platforms and direct company
crawls (Google, Uber) no ATS-token approach can reach. Verified against
three real ground-truth misses a manual clipping audit surfaced: Google's
exact posting (freehire's created_at beat SimplifyJobs' date_posted by ~7
hours), Nuro's exact posting, and a partial match on Uber's. Scoped
deliberately to google/uber only — companies confirmed to have no reachable
Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever token; broader company slugs (Western Digital, Wells
Fargo, Grant Thornton) were tried and dropped after a live dry run surfaced
they were already reachable via SimplifyJobs and added only noise (Wells
Fargo alone: ~20/28 intern-tagged postings non-tech by title). active is
always True (freehire's own closed_at field lags real closures by days,
confirmed live) — not wired into recheck.py's removal checks for the same
reason.

AIJobs (artificialintelligencejobs.co): a single generated snapshot feed,
filtered to level=Intern, degrading to empty on failure like every other
source here.

core/filter.py: _matches_freehire/_matches_ai_jobs share the existing
Greenhouse/Ashby free-text matcher. profile.yaml widened to include Spring
2027 (with a terms_weight field for a later priority pass) and documents two
live-data non-findings: no fellowship/research-shaped listing needs new
matching code, and pay is confirmed out of scope everywhere in this
pipeline.

227/227 tests passing.

Priority-bucket classification, CS-relevance gate, widened contact research

Adds core/classify.py (Layer 2.5b, zero-LLM keyword bucketing into AI/ML,
CyS & Finance, Fullstack, Other) and core/relevance.py (Layer 2.5, two-stage
CS/software-relevance gate: cheap title-only reject before fetch, content-
confirmed adjacent-field check after). vault_writer/writer.py and the
dossier template now sort writes into priority-bucket subfolders under
List/Dossiers/, drop the unused uid/category/promoted frontmatter fields in
favor of next (matching the vault's own note convention), and add a
dossier_uids.json manifest for idempotent re-writes and recheck.py's
removal-checking.

Fixes a real Ashby extraction bug: some sources store the application-form
URL (.../application) instead of the posting page, which renders no job
description at all — confirmed live (the same posting returns 4015 chars of
full content at its base URL vs 1099 chars of bare form fields at
/application). ingestion/posting_page.py now strips that suffix before
fetch.

Widens enrich.py's contact search to recruiter/university-recruiting queries
and LinkedIn search-snippet hits (site:linkedin.com, snippet text only —
never scrapes or logs into linkedin.com, per its own hard line).

Also diversifies ingestion/sources.py's Greenhouse/Ashby seed lists (all-
quant-trading before) with 6 live-verified AI/ML companies: Fireworks AI,
Scale AI, Cohere, Cursor, Modal, ElevenLabs.

258/258 tests passing.
