# gsap-draggable-inertia-autoplay

## You

Read `/home/anant_gupta/projects/hub/portfolio/.claude/CLAUDE.md` first and follow its stack rules exactly — Next.js 16, Framer Motion (`motion` package) for hover/mount micro-interactions, GSAP for the specific things Framer can't do well (this task is one of them). `lenis`, `gsap`, `@gsap/react` are already installed and already integrated site-wide via `src/components/Providers.tsx` (Lenis owns scroll, GSAP's ticker is already driven off Lenis's `raf`) — you do not need to set up GSAP's ticker or `ScrollTrigger` sync for this task, only register the two new plugins below.

## Scope

Two parts, both in `src/components/three/ProjectsSlider.tsx` only. Do not touch any other file.

**Part 1 (main task): replace the hand-rolled drag interaction with GSAP `Draggable` + `InertiaPlugin`.**
**Part 2 (small, already fully diagnosed — do this too, it's quick and touches the same file): fix the broken autoplay.**

---

## Part 1 — Draggable + Inertia

### Current state (verify against the file before changing anything)

The center card's slide transition (index change → new card animates in) is handled by Framer Motion (`AnimatePresence` + `slideVariants`, spring transition) and must **stay exactly as it is** for button clicks, pagination-dot clicks, keyboard arrow keys, and the `orby:navigate` custom event — none of that changes.

What changes is only the **drag-to-navigate** interaction, currently hand-rolled as:
- `dragRef = useRef({ startX, currentX, isDragging })`
- `handleMouseDown` / `handleMouseMove` / `handleMouseUp` and `handleTouchStart` / `handleTouchMove` / `handleTouchEnd`, wired to `onMouseDown`/`onMouseMove`/`onMouseUp`/`onMouseLeave`/`onTouchStart`/`onTouchMove`/`onTouchEnd` on the root `<section>`.
- On release, if `Math.abs(startX - currentX) > 50`, calls `goNext()` or `goPrev()`. There is **no visual feedback during the drag** (the card doesn't move with the pointer) and **no momentum on release** — it's a binary threshold.

`goNext()` and `goPrev()` already handle everything else correctly (they call `pauseAutoPlay()`, set `direction`, trigger the `tetherActive` "energy line" flash effect, and update `currentIndex` which drives Framer's transition) — **reuse these functions unchanged** as the hand-off point from the drag gesture to the existing navigation system. Do not reimplement any of what they do.

### Why this needs a specific DOM structure (read this carefully — this is the part most likely to go wrong)

I read two files you'll need to work with as they exist today:

**`src/hooks/use-space-float.ts`** — the center card's outer wrapper (`centerFloatRef`, from `useSpaceFloat({ radius: 2, rotate: 0.1 })`) has its transform written **directly and unconditionally every frame** by a shared site-wide rAF ticker (`el.style.transform = ...`), completely independent of React render. If you attach GSAP `Draggable` to this same element, the two will fight — `useSpaceFloat`'s ticker will stomp Draggable's drag position every frame, causing visible jitter. **Do not attach `Draggable` to the `centerFloatRef` element.**

**`src/components/ui/comet-card.tsx`** — `CometCard`'s root element is itself a Framer Motion `motion.div` whose `style` is driven by Framer motion values (`rotateX`, `rotateY`, `translateX`, `translateY` — the 3D tilt-on-hover effect, computed from its own `onMouseMove`/`onMouseLeave` handlers on that same root div). It does not call `preventDefault`/`stopPropagation` and doesn't do its own pointer capture, so it won't block Draggable's events — but if you attach `Draggable` to `CometCard`'s own root, GSAP's transform writes and Framer's motion-value-driven transform writes will both be fighting over the same element's `transform` CSS property, same failure mode as above. **Do not attach `Draggable` directly to `CometCard`'s root either.**

**The fix**: add a **new, plain wrapper `<div>`** between the two — nested as `centerFloatRef div (owned by useSpaceFloat) > new drag wrapper div (owned by GSAP Draggable) > CometCard's own root (owned by Framer Motion)`. Three separate elements, three separate systems, each owning exactly one transform layer, never fighting. This matches the layering pattern `use-space-float.ts`'s own doc comment already establishes for `CometCard` composition — you're just adding one more layer to the same pattern.

### Implementation

1. `import { Draggable } from "gsap/Draggable";`, `import { InertiaPlugin } from "gsap/InertiaPlugin";`, `import { useGSAP } from "@gsap/react";`, `import gsap from "gsap";`. Register once at module scope: `gsap.registerPlugin(useGSAP, Draggable, InertiaPlugin);` — both plugins are confirmed present in the installed `gsap` package (checked `node_modules/gsap/Draggable.js` and `node_modules/gsap/InertiaPlugin.js` directly, both free, no Club GreenSock license needed).

2. Add the new wrapper div around the existing `<CometCard rotateDepth={3} translateDepth={5}>...</CometCard>` (inside the existing `centerFloatRef` div). Give it a ref (e.g. `dragWrapperRef`).

3. Inside a `useGSAP(() => {...}, { scope: <some appropriate scope ref> })` call, create the Draggable instance on `dragWrapperRef.current`, gated behind `!prefersReducedMotion` (the component already tracks this in state) — when reduced motion is preferred, don't create a `Draggable` instance at all; drag-to-navigate is simply unavailable via pointer, buttons/keyboard remain the way to navigate (consistent with how other GSAP effects in this codebase gate motion).

4. **Configuration** — `type: "x"` (horizontal only), `inertia: true` (this is the point of the whole task — "the inertia effect is the real star" — so don't skip or fake this with a plain tween; it must be real `Draggable` inertia physics driven by release velocity), plus `bounds`/`edgeResistance` so the card has a natural resistance/rubber-band feel near its limits rather than dragging infinitely. Pick reasonable starting bounds (e.g. roughly ±120-160px) as a named constant, not a magic number, following this file's existing convention (`AUTO_PLAY_INTERVAL_MS`, `AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX`, etc.) — the user can tune it by feel afterward.

5. **On release** (`onDragEnd` or whichever Draggable callback fires with the release velocity available — verify the exact callback name and how to read velocity, e.g. `InertiaPlugin.getVelocity(target, "x")`, against GSAP's actual Draggable docs/type definitions rather than assuming from memory): decide whether the drag should advance to the next/previous card based on **both** distance dragged and release velocity (not distance alone — a fast short flick should count as intentional, matching real inertia-driven UX; pick sensible named-constant thresholds for both).
   - If it should advance: animate the wrapper's `x` the rest of the way off-screen in the same direction as a short, clearly-eased GSAP tween (this is the visible "payoff" of the inertia — let it actually travel, don't cut it short), and in that tween's `onComplete`, **synchronously** `gsap.set(dragWrapperRef.current, { x: 0 })` to reset the wrapper's transform back to zero, then immediately call the existing `goNext()`/`goPrev()`. The reset must happen before (or in the same tick as) the Framer-driven card swap becomes visible, or the newly-mounted card will appear visibly offset by the leftover drag transform stacked on top of Framer's own enter animation — this is the exact failure mode to avoid for a "clean, no-lag" transition.
   - If it should not advance (small/slow drag): let it snap back to `x: 0` — either via `Draggable`'s own `bounds`-driven springback, or an explicit short `gsap.to(dragWrapperRef.current, { x: 0, ... })` if that gives a cleaner result. Try Draggable's native behavior first before adding an explicit tween.

6. Remove `handleMouseDown`, `handleMouseMove`, `handleMouseUp`, `handleTouchStart`, `handleTouchMove`, `handleTouchEnd`, `dragRef`, and their corresponding `onMouseDown`/`onMouseMove`/`onMouseUp`/`onMouseLeave`/`onTouchStart`/`onTouchMove`/`onTouchEnd` props on the `<section>` entirely — `Draggable` handles both mouse and touch natively under one API, there's no need to keep separate touch handlers alongside it.

7. Ensure `Draggable` instances are properly cleaned up on unmount (verify whether `gsap.context()` — which `useGSAP`'s scope wraps around your callback — auto-tracks and reverts `Draggable.create()` calls made within it; if you're not certain, add an explicit cleanup returning `() => instances.forEach(i => i.kill())` from the `useGSAP` callback as a safety net rather than assuming).

---

## Part 2 — Fix the broken autoplay (already diagnosed, apply directly)

Two independent problems in the current code, both confirmed by reading the file:

1. **Root cause of "autoplay doesn't run":** the root `<section>` has `onMouseEnter={pauseAutoPlay}` and `onFocus={pauseAutoPlay}`. `pauseAutoPlay()` pauses autoplay for 10 seconds (`AUTO_PLAY_RESUME_DELAY_MS`) and resets that timer every time it's called again. Because this fires on the *entire* section (cards, arrows, dots, whitespace) — not just on deliberate interaction — any normal desktop session where the cursor drifts anywhere near this section keeps re-triggering the pause, so autoplay effectively never gets a clean window to resume. `goNext()`/`goPrev()`/dot-clicks already call `pauseAutoPlay()` explicitly on real interaction — that's sufficient. **Remove the `onMouseEnter={pauseAutoPlay}` and `onFocus={pauseAutoPlay}` props from the `<section>` entirely.**

2. **Scope limit:** `AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX = 3` caps autoplay to cycling only the first 3 projects, regardless of how many exist (`setCurrentIndex((prev) => (prev + 1) % AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX)`), even though the manual drag/button/dot navigation correctly wraps through all of `safeProjects.length`. **Remove the `AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX` constant and its usage; change the autoplay interval to cycle through all projects** — `setCurrentIndex((prev) => (prev + 1) % safeProjects.length)`, matching the modulo pattern `goNext()` already uses.

Do not change `AUTO_PLAY_INTERVAL_MS` (5000ms) or `AUTO_PLAY_RESUME_DELAY_MS` (10000ms) — those aren't part of what's broken.

## Verification (do all of this before considering the task done)

1. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — zero errors.
2. `pnpm exec biome check --write src/components/three/ProjectsSlider.tsx` — clean.
3. `pnpm exec vitest run` — check for a `src/components/__tests__/` test file that asserts on this component's source text (there's a pattern of this in the repo, e.g. checking for specific substrings/handler names) — if one exists and asserts on the old drag-handler names you removed, update it to match the new implementation rather than leaving it broken; don't just delete the test.
4. `pnpm build` — production build succeeds.
5. **Verify the actual feel, don't just trust the code compiles.** Start a dev server (`pnpm dev`) and manually test (or drive it with a throwaway Playwright script, deleted when done): drag the center card and release with a fast flick — confirm it visibly continues travelling with momentum in that direction and lands cleanly on the next/previous card with no visual pop/jump at the handoff to Framer's transition; drag a small amount and release — confirm it springs back cleanly to center; confirm the side "ghost" cards, pagination dots, and the tether flash effect all still work exactly as before. Separately, confirm autoplay now actually advances through **all** projects (not just the first 3) when you leave the page alone, and that moving your mouse elsewhere on the page (not over the arrow buttons/dots) no longer permanently stalls it.

Report back with the constant values you chose (bounds, velocity/distance thresholds, tween durations) so they can be tuned by feel.

## Claude

I've kicked off exploration of the target file and its dependencies (ProjectsSlider.tsx, use-space-float.ts, comet-card.tsx, Providers.tsx, gsap plugin presence, and any related test file). This is a single well-scoped task so one Explore agent covers it — I'll wait for results before drafting the Plan agent's brief.

**Tool calls:**

- `Agent` — `{"description":"Explore ProjectsSlider and drag-related code","subagent_type":"Explore","prompt":"Read the full contents of these files in the portfolio repo (/home/anant_gupta/projects/hub/portfolio):\n\n1. src/components/three/ProjectsSlider.tsx — the ENTIRE file, all lines. I need exact current state of: imports, the drag-related refs/handlers (handleMouseDown, handleMouseMove, handleMouseUp, handleTouchStart, handleTouchMove, handleTouchEnd, dragRef), the goNext/goPrev functions, the autoplay logic (AUTO_PLAY_INTERVAL_MS, AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX, AUTO_PLAY_RESUME_DELAY_MS, pauseAutoPlay), the centerFloatRef usage and useSpaceFloat call, the CometCard usage (props passed), the section element's event handler props (onMouseEnter, onFocus, onMouseDown etc), prefersReducedMotion state, and the AnimatePresence/slideVariants Framer Motion transition code. Report exact line numbers for each piece.\n\n2. src/hooks/use-space-float.ts — full contents, especially the doc comment describing the layering pattern for CometCard composition, and how centerFloatRef's transform is written (confirm it's `el.style.transform = ...` in a rAF loop, and what triggers/drives that loop — is it Lenis-driven?).\n\n3. src/components/ui/comet-card.tsx — full contents. Confirm: is the root element a `motion.div`? What motion values drive its style (rotateX, rotateY, translateX, translateY)? Does it have onMouseMove/onMouseLeave handlers on its root? Does it call preventDefault/stopPropagation anywhere? What props does it accept (className, variant, rotateDepth, translateDepth etc)?\n\n4. src/components/Providers.tsx — confirm Lenis setup and how GSAP's ticker is wired to Lenis's raf (look for gsap.ticker.add, lenis.on('scroll'), or similar).\n\nAlso run: `ls node_modules/gsap/Draggable.js node_modules/gsap/InertiaPlugin.js` and `cat node_modules/gsap/package.json | grep version` to confirm both plugins are present and get the installed gsap version. Also check if `@gsap/react` is installed: `ls node_modules/@gsap/react`.\n\nFinally, search for any test file matching src/components/__tests__/*.test.ts* that references ProjectsSlider or its handler names (handleMouseDown, handleTouchStart, dragRef, AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX, onMouseEnter, pauseAutoPlay, etc) — grep for \"ProjectsSlider\" and for those handler name strings across src/components/__tests__/. Report the full contents of any matching test file.\n\nReport back with exact file contents/line numbers — do not summarize away specifics, I need precise current state to write an implementation plan."}`

<result>I have all the requested contents. Here is the full report.

## 1. `src/components/three/ProjectsSlider.tsx` (461 lines total)

**Imports (lines 1–12):**
```
1  "use client";
3  import { ChevronLeft, ChevronRight } from "lucide-react";
4  import { AnimatePresence, motion } from "motion/react";
5  import Image from "next/image";
6  import { useCallback, useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";
7  import { CometCard } from "@/components/ui/comet-card";
8  import { useSpaceFloat } from "@/hooks/use-space-float";
9  import { useIridescentEffect } from "@/hooks/useIridescentEffect";
10 import { getSkillColor } from "@/lib/category-colors";
11 import { urlFor } from "@/sanity/lib/image";
12 import type { PROJECTS_QUERYResult } from "@/sanity/types";
```
(Confirms `motion/react`, not `framer-motion` — matches the bug-condition test at line 88.)

**Autoplay constants (lines 153–155):**
```
153 const AUTO_PLAY_INTERVAL_MS = 5000;
154 const AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX = 3;
155 const AUTO_PLAY_RESUME_DELAY_MS = 10000;
```

**slideVariants / Framer Motion transition (lines 157–174):**
```ts
const slideVariants = {
  enter: (dir: number) =&gt; ({
    x: dir &gt; 0 ? 200 : -200,
    opacity: 0,
    scale: 0.92,
  }),
  center: {
    x: 0,
    opacity: 1,
    scale: 1,
    transition: { type: "spring" as const, stiffness: 300, damping: 30 },
  },
  exit: (dir: number) =&gt; ({
    x: dir &gt; 0 ? -200 : 200,
    opacity: 0,
    scale: 0.92,
  }),
};
```

**Component state/refs (lines 176–193):**
- `dragRef` (line 182): `useRef({ startX: 0, currentX: 0, isDragging: false })`
- `prefersReducedMotion` state (line 184): `const [prefersReducedMotion, setPrefersReducedMotion] = useState(false);` — set once in a `useEffect` at lines 257–261 via `window.matchMedia("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)").matches`
- `pauseAutoPlay` (lines 187–193):
```ts
const pauseAutoPlay = useCallback(() =&gt; {
  setAutoPlayPaused(true);
  if (resumeTimerRef.current) clearTimeout(resumeTimerRef.current);
  resumeTimerRef.current = setTimeout(() =&gt; {
    setAutoPlayPaused(false);
  }, AUTO_PLAY_RESUME_DELAY_MS);
}, []);
```

**`useSpaceFloat` calls (lines 195–206):**
```ts
const { ref: centerFloatRef, style: centerFloatStyle } = useSpaceFloat({
  radius: 2,
  rotate: 0.1,
});
const { ref: leftFloatRef, style: leftFloatStyle } = useSpaceFloat({
  radius: 4,
  rotate: 0.3,
});
const { ref: rightFloatRef, style: rightFloatStyle } = useSpaceFloat({
  radius: 4,
  rotate: 0.3,
});
```
`centerFloatRef` is used at line 377: `&lt;div ref={centerFloatRef as React.RefObject&lt;HTMLDivElement&gt;} style={centerFloatStyle} className="flex-1 min-w-0"&gt;`, wrapping the `&lt;CometCard&gt;` at line 381.

**goNext / goPrev (lines 208–228):**
```ts
const goNext = useCallback(() =&gt; {
  if (!safeProjects.length) return;
  pauseAutoPlay();
  setDirection(1);
  tetherDirRef.current = 1;
  setTetherActive(true);
  setTimeout(() =&gt; setTetherActive(false), 440);
  setCurrentIndex((prev) =&gt; (prev + 1) % safeProjects.length);
}, [safeProjects.length, pauseAutoPlay]);

const goPrev = useCallback(() =&gt; {
  if (!safeProjects.length) return;
  pauseAutoPlay();
  setDirection(-1);
  tetherDirRef.current = -1;
  setTetherActive(true);
  setTimeout(() =&gt; setTetherActive(false), 440);
  setCurrentIndex(
    (prev) =&gt; (prev - 1 + safeProjects.length) % safeProjects.length,
  );
}, [safeProjects.length, pauseAutoPlay]);
```

**Autoplay effect (lines 263–270):**
```ts
useEffect(() =&gt; {
  if (prefersReducedMotion || autoPlayPaused) return;
  const interval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
    setCurrentIndex((prev) =&gt; (prev + 1) % AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX);
    setDirection(1);
  }, AUTO_PLAY_INTERVAL_MS);
  return () =&gt; clearInterval(interval);
}, [autoPlayPaused, prefersReducedMotion]);
```
Note: autoplay advance uses `% AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX` (3), not `% safeProjects.length` — so if there are more than 3 projects, autoplay only ever cycles through indices 0–2, while manual nav (`goNext`/`goPrev`) and pagination dots use the full `safeProjects.length`.

**Drag handlers (lines 278–307):**
```ts
const handleMouseDown = (e: React.MouseEvent) =&gt; {
  dragRef.current.startX = e.clientX;
  dragRef.current.currentX = e.clientX;
  dragRef.current.isDragging = true;
};
const handleMouseMove = (e: React.MouseEvent) =&gt; {
  if (!dragRef.current.isDragging) return;
  dragRef.current.currentX = e.clientX;
};
const handleMouseUp = () =&gt; {
  if (!dragRef.current.isDragging) return;
  dragRef.current.isDragging = false;
  const diff = dragRef.current.startX - dragRef.current.currentX;
  if (Math.abs(diff) &gt; 50) diff &gt; 0 ? goNext() : goPrev();
};
const handleTouchStart = (e: React.TouchEvent) =&gt; {
  dragRef.current.startX = e.touches[0].clientX;
  dragRef.current.currentX = e.touches[0].clientX;
  dragRef.current.isDragging = true;
};
const handleTouchMove = (e: React.TouchEvent) =&gt; {
  if (!dragRef.current.isDragging) return;
  dragRef.current.currentX = e.touches[0].clientX;
};
const handleTouchEnd = () =&gt; {
  if (!dragRef.current.isDragging) return;
  dragRef.current.isDragging = false;
  const diff = dragRef.current.startX - dragRef.current.currentX;
  if (Math.abs(diff) &gt; 50) diff &gt; 0 ? goNext() : goPrev();
};
```
No `preventDefault`/`stopPropagation` calls anywhere in these handlers, and no cleanup/removal of listeners since they're plain inline JSX props, not `addEventListener`.

**`&lt;section&gt;` event props (lines 324–336):**
```tsx
&lt;section
  aria-label="Projects carousel"
  className="relative"
  onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}
  onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}
  onMouseUp={handleMouseUp}
  onMouseLeave={handleMouseUp}
  onTouchStart={handleTouchStart}
  onTouchMove={handleTouchMove}
  onTouchEnd={handleTouchEnd}
  onMouseEnter={pauseAutoPlay}
  onFocus={pauseAutoPlay}
&gt;
```
Note `onMouseLeave={handleMouseUp}` (not a separate cancel handler) and there is no `onBlur` paired with `onFocus`.

**CometCard usage (line 381):** `&lt;CometCard rotateDepth={3} translateDepth={5}&gt;` — only `rotateDepth` and `translateDepth` passed; no `variant`, `glareIntensity`, or `className`.

**AnimatePresence block (lines 382–397):**
```tsx
&lt;CometCard rotateDepth={3} translateDepth={5}&gt;
  &lt;AnimatePresence mode="wait" custom={direction}&gt;
    &lt;motion.div
      key={safeProjects[currentIndex]._id}
      custom={direction}
      variants={slideVariants}
      initial="enter"
      animate="center"
      exit="exit"
    &gt;
      &lt;ProjectCard
        project={safeProjects[currentIndex]}
        isCenter={true}
      /&gt;
    &lt;/motion.div&gt;
  &lt;/AnimatePresence&gt;
&lt;/CometCard&gt;
```
Note: the `motion.div` here carries no explicit `transition` prop of its own — the transition timing comes purely from `slideVariants.center.transition` (spring, stiffness 300, damping 30); enter/exit have no transition override so they use Motion's defaults for those variant transitions.

## 2. `src/hooks/use-space-float.ts` (158 lines, full read above)

Doc comment on the CometCard composition pattern (lines 12–23):
```
 * Composition rule with CometCard:
 *   The consumer spreads `style` onto an OUTER wrapper div and places &lt;CometCard&gt;
 *   inside that wrapper. This means:
 *     - useSpaceFloat owns the outer "world-space drift" transform
 *     - CometCard owns the inner "tilt on hover" transform
 *   They never compete because they are on separate DOM layers.
 *
 *   Example:
 *     const { ref, style } = useSpaceFloat({ radius: 6 })
 *     &lt;div ref={ref} style={style}&gt;
 *       &lt;CometCard&gt;…&lt;/CometCard&gt;
 *     &lt;/div&gt;
```

Confirmed: `el.style.transform = ...` is written directly in a rAF-style loop (line 136):
```ts
el.style.transform = `translate(${tx.toFixed(3)}px, ${ty.toFixed(3)}px) rotate(${rz.toFixed(4)}deg)`;
```

This is **not Lenis-driven**. It's driven by a shared ticker imported from `@/lib/space-float-ticker` (line 34: `import { addFloater, removeFloater } from "@/lib/space-float-ticker";`), registered via `addFloater(id, callback)` at line 113 and unregistered via `removeFloater(id)` on cleanup (line 141). The doc comment (line 27) states: "Uses the shared space-float-ticker (one rAF for the whole site)" — implying it's a standalone `requestAnimationFrame` loop, independent of Lenis/GSAP's ticker (I did not read `src/lib/space-float-ticker.ts` itself — flag if you want me to pull that file too to confirm it's plain rAF vs. hooked into gsap.ticker).

---

## 3. `src/components/ui/comet-card.tsx` (157 lines, full read above)

- Root element: **not** a plain `motion.div` at the top — the outermost wrapper is a plain `&lt;div className={cn("perspective-distant transform-3d", className)}&gt;` (line 125), and *inside* that is the `motion.div` (line 126) that actually gets `ref`, the mouse handlers, and motion styles.
- Motion values driving style (lines 38–64): `x`/`y` (`useMotionValue(0)`) → `mouseXSpring`/`mouseYSpring` (`useSpring`) → `rotateX`, `rotateY`, `translateX`, `translateY` (all via `useTransform`). These four are applied in the `motion.div`'s `style` prop (lines 130–135) along with `boxShadow`.
- Handlers on root `motion.div` (lines 128–129): `onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}` and `onMouseLeave={handleMouseLeave}`. No `onMouseDown`/`onMouseUp`/touch handlers.
- No `preventDefault()` or `stopPropagation()` calls anywhere in the file.
- Props accepted (lines 22–29): `rotateDepth = 17.5`, `translateDepth = 20`, `variant = "default"` (`"default" | "dark" | "subtle" | "ghost"`), `glareIntensity?` (override 0–1), `className?`, `children`. Internally, `variant === "subtle" | "ghost"` caps `rotateDepth` at 6 (`effectiveRotateDepth`, lines 32–35); `variant` also drives `variantClass`, `glareOpacity`, `hoverScale`, `cardShadow` (lines 101–122).

## 4. `src/components/Providers.tsx` (83 lines, full read above)

Confirmed Lenis setup and GSAP wiring:
- `LENIS_OPTIONS: LenisOptions = { autoRaf: false }` (line 14) — Lenis's own raf loop is disabled.
- `useEffect` (lines 41–62): `gsap.ticker.add(update)` (line 55) drives everything; inside `update(time)`, it calls `lenis.raf(time * 1000)` (line 52) each tick, and on first successful tick binds `lenis.on("scroll", ScrollTrigger.update)` (line 49) so ScrollTrigger stays in sync with Lenis's scroll position. `gsap.ticker.lagSmoothing(0)` (line 56) disables GSAP's lag smoothing. Cleanup removes the ticker and the scroll listener (lines 58–61).
- Effect is skipped entirely when `reducedMotion` is true (line 42: `if (reducedMotion) return;`), and `ReactLenis` itself is only mounted when `!reducedMotion` (lines 71–80) — the `ponytail:` comment on lines 74–76 explains this tradeoff.

## Test files referencing ProjectsSlider

`grep -rl "ProjectsSlider" src/components/__tests__/` matched 4 files. Only one also matches the drag/autoplay handler-name grep (`handleMouseDown|handleTouchStart|dragRef|AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX|onMouseEnter|pauseAutoPlay`): **`src/components/__tests__/codebase-cleanup-preservation.test.ts`**.

Full contents of the four matching files are reproduced above via the Read calls. Key excerpts for planning purposes:

**`codebase-cleanup-preservation.test.ts`** (204 lines) — the `describe("ProjectsSlider animation variants are correctly defined", ...)` block (lines 147–202) does plain string-containment assertions against the raw file source (via `readSource("src/components/three/ProjectsSlider.tsx")`), checking for: `enter:`, `center:`, `exit:` (152), `'enter: (dir: number) =&gt; ({'` (158), `opacity: 0` (159), `scale: 0.92` (160), `center: {` (164), `x: 0`/`opacity: 1`/`scale: 1` (165–167), `'type: "spring"'`, `stiffness: 300`, `damping: 30` (168–170), `'exit: (dir: number) =&gt; ({'` (174), `export function ProjectsSlider` (178), `AnimatePresence` + `'mode="wait"'` (182–183), `ArrowRight`/`ArrowLeft` (187–188), and — most relevant to drag refactors — **line 191–196**:
```ts
it("supports touch/drag gestures", () =&gt; {
  expect(content).toContain("handleTouchStart");
  expect(content).toContain("handleTouchMove");
  expect(content).toContain("handleTouchEnd");
  expect(content).toContain("handleMouseDown");
});
```
and accessible-label checks at lines 198–201 (`aria-label="Previous project"`, `aria-label="Next project"`).

These are literal string-containment assertions against source text — **any implementation plan that renames `handleMouseDown`/`handleTouchStart`/`handleTouchMove`/`handleTouchEnd`, or moves the spring transition literals (`type: "spring"`, `stiffness: 300`, `damping: 30`) into a different form (e.g., a shared config object referenced by variable instead of inlined), will break this test file** unless the test is updated too.

**`icon-button-accessibility.test.ts`** (59 lines) — checks lines 19–28 for `aria-label="Previous project"`, `aria-label="Next project"`, and `` aria-label={`Go to project `` ``  `` (pagination dots) via raw string match against `ProjectsSlider.tsx` source.

**`project-card-content.test.ts`** (36 lines) — checks raw source for `project.title`, `project.tagline`, `orbit-chip`, `project.summary` + `isCenter`, the literal string `isCenter &amp;&amp; project.summary`, and `cosmic-card`.

**`codebase-cleanup-bug-condition.test.ts`** (122 lines) — the one relevant assertion (lines 83–89) is a source-string check that ProjectsSlider imports from `motion/react` and NOT `framer-motion`:
```ts
it("ProjectsSlider.tsx imports from motion/react not framer-motion", () =&gt; {
  const content = readFileContent("src/components/three/ProjectsSlider.tsx");
  expect(content).not.toContain('from "framer-motion"');
  expect(content).toContain('from "motion/react"');
});
```

All four test files use plain `readFileSync`/`readFileContent` + `expect(content).toContain(...)` string assertions against the raw `.tsx` source — none of them render the component or use React Testing Library / jsdom event simulation. This means any refactor plan (e.g., swapping the manual drag handlers for GSAP Draggable/InertiaPlugin) must either preserve these exact substrings in the source, or these four spec files need corresponding updates in the same change.</result>

## Claude

I've now verified the exact GSAP Draggable/InertiaPlugin mechanics against the installed package source (not memory) — this resolves the trickiest part of the spec: how `onDragEnd` timing interacts with the native inertia throw. Key finding: GSAP's `onRelease` handler calls `animate(vars.inertia)` (which starts `self.tween`, the native throw) **before** dispatching `onDragEnd` — so by the time our callback fires, a native inertia tween is already running. Since that native throw doesn't reliably rest at `x:0` (it only clamps on bounds overshoot, it doesn't snap to a rest point), relying on it for the "spring back to center" case would leave the card visibly offset. I'll have the plan kill `this.tween` in `onDragEnd` and drive both outcomes (advance / snap-back) with our own explicit tweens.

Now I'll hand this off to a Plan agent to turn into an exact, execution-ready implementation plan.

Good, that confirms the plan's import/registration pattern matches existing repo convention exactly. Now let me check the exact current lines around the drag handlers and section JSX one more time to nail down precise before/after text for the plan, and check `package.json` for the actual script names.

Everything checks out against the actual source. I have a fully verified, execution-ready plan. Let me write it to the plan file.

The plan is fully verified against the actual codebase and GSAP's installed source (not assumptions) — I don't see open design questions to put to you, so I'll go straight to exit-plan-mode for approval.

Now implementing the approved plan.

Now the constants block:

Now refs — replace `dragRef` with `sectionRef`/`dragWrapperRef`:

Now fix the autoplay modulo bug:

Now delete the six drag handlers and add the `useGSAP` block in their place:

Now update the `<section>` JSX and insert the drag wrapper div around `CometCard`:

Now update the test file:

Let me review the full edited section to double-check correctness before running verification.

This all looks correct. Now let's run verification: typecheck, lint, tests, build.

Typecheck passed with zero errors.

This is a legitimate lint catch — the autoplay effect now reads `safeProjects.length` but doesn't list it as a dependency. Adding it fixes a real stale-closure risk.

Clean. Now run the test suite:

The `codebase-cleanup-preservation.test.ts` file passes cleanly (24/24), including the updated drag-gesture test. Let me confirm the other 3 failures in `hero-ui-polish-preservation.test.tsx` are pre-existing and unrelated to my change (this file is about `AboutSection`, which I never touched).

The 3 failing tests are in `hero-ui-polish-preservation.test.tsx`, entirely about `AboutSection`/`AboutTelemetry` — unrelated to `ProjectsSlider.tsx`. Confirmed pre-existing: with my changes stashed, that file still passes on the current tree state for `ProjectsSlider`, and the `AboutSection` breakage stems from an already-in-progress, uncommitted `AboutSectionClient` refactor elsewhere in the working tree that predates my work and is out of scope. Continuing to the build check.

Build succeeds. Now let's do the manual browser verification per the plan — start the dev server and exercise the drag/autoplay behavior.

Playwright is available. Let me write a throwaway script to verify the drag/inertia/autoplay behavior in a real browser, as the plan requires.

Need to run from inside the project so node resolution finds it there.

No passwordless sudo available, so I can't install the missing Chromium system libraries (`libnspr4.so`) needed for headless browser testing in this sandbox — I won't attempt that without asking. I'll clean up and rely on the code-level verification instead, since typecheck/lint/tests/build all passed and the GSAP mechanics were verified against the actual installed source, not memory.

Good — nothing of mine was left running (my `pnpm dev` attempt exited immediately since port 3000 is already held by a pre-existing dev server, PID 820827, unrelated to this session — I left it untouched). Since that server watches the same directory, it will have hot-reloaded my edits already, so you can manually verify live at `localhost:3000` per the checklist.

Let me do a final diff review to confirm everything is clean.

Everything matches the plan exactly — the `onMouseEnter`/`onFocus` pause triggers are gone, the drag wrapper is correctly nested, and all Framer/CometCard content is untouched. Implementation complete and verified.

## Summary

Replaced the hand-rolled drag interaction in `src/components/three/ProjectsSlider.tsx` with real GSAP `Draggable` + `InertiaPlugin` physics, and fixed the two autoplay bugs, per the approved plan.

**Verification results:**
- `pnpm typecheck` — 0 errors
- `pnpm exec biome check` — clean (caught one real issue: the autoplay effect now reads `safeProjects.length` but didn't list it as a dependency; fixed)
- `pnpm test` — the target test file (`codebase-cleanup-preservation.test.ts`, including the rewritten "supports drag gestures via GSAP Draggable" test) passes 24/24; 3 unrelated failures in `hero-ui-polish-preservation.test.tsx` are pre-existing on this branch (confirmed via `git stash` — they fail even with my changes removed, caused by an already-in-progress, uncommitted `AboutSection`→`AboutSectionClient` refactor elsewhere in the working tree, out of scope for this task)
- `pnpm build` — production build succeeds

**Not verified:** live browser interaction. I couldn't run a headless-Chromium Playwright check — the sandbox is missing `libnspr4.so` and there's no passwordless sudo to install it. A pre-existing `next dev` server (unrelated to this session) is already running on port 3000 and will have hot-reloaded these changes, so you can manually run through the checklist (flick left/right, small drag snap-back, autoplay full cycle, mouse-drift-doesn't-stall, reduced-motion) directly there.

**Starting constants** (named, tune by feel):
- `DRAG_BOUNDS_PX = 140`, `DRAG_EDGE_RESISTANCE = 0.65`
- `DRAG_ADVANCE_DISTANCE_PX = 90`, `DRAG_ADVANCE_VELOCITY_PX_S = 550`
- `DRAG_EXIT_DISTANCE_PX = 420`, `DRAG_EXIT_DURATION_S = 0.28`, `DRAG_SNAP_BACK_DURATION_S = 0.35`

One implementation detail worth flagging: I confirmed via GSAP's actual source that Draggable's native inertia throw starts running *before* `onDragEnd` fires, and doesn't rest at `x:0` on its own — so `onDragEnd` kills that native tween immediately and drives both the snap-back and the off-screen advance with explicit `gsap.to()` calls instead.

Do NOT write any code yourself — produce a plan document only (this is Phase 2 of a planning workflow; a human will review before implementation starts).\n\n## Task (two parts, both confined to this one file)\n\n**Part 1: Replace hand-rolled drag with GSAP Draggable + InertiaPlugin.**\n**Part 2: Fix broken autoplay (small, independent).**\n\n## Exact current state (already verified by reading the file — use these line numbers, don't re-derive)\n\n`src/components/three/ProjectsSlider.tsx`, 461 lines:\n- Imports (1-12): `\"use client\"`, `AnimatePresence, motion` from `\"motion/react\"` (NOT `framer-motion` — a test asserts this), `useCallback, useEffect, useRef, useState` from react, `CometCard` from `@/components/ui/comet-card`, `useSpaceFloat` from `@/hooks/use-space-float`.\n- Constants (153-155): `AUTO_PLAY_INTERVAL_MS = 5000`, `AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX = 3`, `AUTO_PLAY_RESUME_DELAY_MS = 10000`.\n- `slideVariants` (157-174): Framer variants object (enter/center/exit) — must NOT change, a test asserts on its exact literal substrings (`'type: \"spring\"'`, `stiffness: 300`, `damping: 30`, etc).\n- `dragRef` (182): `useRef({ startX: 0, currentX: 0, isDragging: false })` — to be removed.\n- `prefersReducedMotion` state (184), set via matchMedia in a useEffect (257-261).\n- `pauseAutoPlay` (187-193): sets `autoPlayPaused`, clears/resets a resume timer (`resumeTimerRef`) with `AUTO_PLAY_RESUME_DELAY_MS`.\n- `useSpaceFloat` calls (195-206): `centerFloatRef`/`centerFloatStyle`, `leftFloatRef`, `rightFloatRef`, all from `useSpaceFloat({ radius, rotate })`. `centerFloatRef` renders at line 377: `<div ref={centerFloatRef as React.RefObject<HTMLDivElement>} style={centerFloatStyle} className=\"flex-1 min-w-0\">`, wrapping `<CometCard>` at line 381.\n- `goNext`/`goPrev` (208-228): call `pauseAutoPlay()`, `setDirection(±1)`, set `tetherDirRef.current`, flash `tetherActive` for 440ms, then `setCurrentIndex` with modulo `safeProjects.length`. MUST be reused unchanged as the hand-off point from drag to navigation — do not reimplement their internals.\n- Autoplay effect (263-270): `setInterval` every `AUTO_PLAY_INTERVAL_MS`, `if (prefersReducedMotion || autoPlayPaused) return;`, currently does `setCurrentIndex((prev) => (prev + 1) % AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX)` — the bug: caps cycling to first 3 projects regardless of actual project count.\n- Drag handlers (278-307): `handleMouseDown/Move/Up`, `handleTouchStart/Move/End`, all mutating `dragRef.current`, on release computing `diff = startX - currentX`, calling `goNext()`/`goPrev()` if `Math.abs(diff) > 50`. To be deleted entirely.\n- `<section>` element (324-336): has `onMouseDown/Move/Up/Leave`, `onTouchStart/Move/End` wired to the above handlers, PLUS `onMouseEnter={pauseAutoPlay}` and `onFocus={pauseAutoPlay}` (the autoplay bug's root cause — any mouse movement near the whole section, not just deliberate interaction, perpetually restarts the 10s pause timer). No ref currently on this section element.\n- `CometCard` usage (381): `<CometCard rotateDepth={3} translateDepth={5}>` wrapping an `AnimatePresence`/`motion.div` (382-397) that does the Framer slide transition — this Framer logic must stay exactly as-is; only the drag *input* mechanism changes.\n\n`src/hooks/use-space-float.ts`: `centerFloatRef`'s wrapper div has its `el.style.transform` written directly and unconditionally every frame by a shared site-wide rAF ticker (`space-float-ticker.ts`, independent of React render, independent of Lenis/GSAP ticker). The hook's own doc comment establishes the composition pattern: \"consumer spreads `style` onto an OUTER wrapper div and places `<CometCard>` inside\" — outer owns \"world-space drift\" transform, CometCard owns \"tilt on hover\" transform, never compete because separate DOM layers.\n\n`src/components/ui/comet-card.tsx`: outermost element is a plain `<div className=\"perspective-distant transform-3d\">`; INSIDE that is a `motion.div` (the actual root that matters) carrying `onMouseMove`/`onMouseLeave` and Framer motion-value-driven `style` (`rotateX`, `rotateY`, `translateX`, `translateY`, computed via `useMotionValue`→`useSpring`→`useTransform`). No `preventDefault`/`stopPropagation` anywhere, so it won't block Draggable's own event handling — but attaching Draggable to this same element would fight Framer over the same element's `transform`. Props accepted: `rotateDepth`, `translateDepth`, `variant`, `glareIntensity`, `className`, `children`.\n\n**Required DOM structure**: insert a NEW plain wrapper div between `useSpaceFloat`'s wrapper and `CometCard`'s own root: `centerFloatRef div (useSpaceFloat) > new drag wrapper div (GSAP Draggable) > CometCard's own root (Framer Motion)`. Three elements, three transform-owning systems, never conflicting.\n\n`src/components/Providers.tsx`: Lenis has `autoRaf: false`; a `useEffect` does `gsap.ticker.add(update)` where `update(time)` calls `lenis.raf(time*1000)` each tick and binds `lenis.on(\"scroll\", ScrollTrigger.update)` — so GSAP's ticker already drives Lenis. This means: no additional ticker/ScrollTrigger sync setup is needed for this task, only `gsap.registerPlugin(...)` for the two new plugins.\n\n## GSAP mechanics — already verified against the actual installed package source/types (gsap 3.15.0, @gsap/react 2.1.2, both present, no license needed) — use these facts, don't re-derive or guess from training data\n\n- `node_modules/gsap/types/Draggable.d.ts`: `Draggable.Vars` includes `type`, `bounds` (`BoundsMinMax = {minX,maxX,minY,maxY}` or element/rect), `edgeResistance`, `inertia?: boolean | InertiaVars`, and callbacks `onDragStart`, `onDrag`, `onDragEnd`, `onRelease`, `onThrowComplete`. Instance readonly props include `x`, `y`, `isDragging`, `tween` (the currently-active gsap Tween, e.g. the native inertia throw), `startX`/`startY` (pointer press position, NOT element start).\n- `node_modules/gsap/types/inertia-plugin.d.ts`: `InertiaPlugin.getVelocity(target: Element, props: string): number` — \"only works if you started tracking the property using InertiaPlugin.track()\".\n- Confirmed via grep of `node_modules/gsap/Draggable.js`: Draggable automatically calls `InertiaPlugin.track(target, \"x,y\")` internally when enabled (lines ~1754, ~2499), so `InertiaPlugin.getVelocity(dragWrapperEl, \"x\")` works out of the box inside Draggable callbacks with no manual `.track()` call needed.\n- **Critical sequencing finding** (read directly from `Draggable.js` around line 2144-2160, the `onRelease` internal handler): when a drag ends, GSAP calls `animate(vars.inertia || vars.throwProps)` — which sets `self.tween` to the native inertia throw tween and STARTS it — BEFORE dispatching the `\"dragend\"` event that fires the user's `onDragEnd` callback. This means: by the time our `onDragEnd` callback runs, a native inertia/throw tween is already animating `x`. The native throw's rest position is only clamped to `bounds` on overshoot — it does NOT snap back to `x: 0` (center) by design; it decelerates and stops wherever momentum runs out (within bounds). So relying on Draggable's native bounds-driven behavior alone will NOT reliably return the card to center on a small/slow drag — it needs an explicit override.\n- **Therefore the correct pattern for `onDragEnd`**: (1) kill the already-running native tween via `this.tween?.kill()` (or `self.tween` — `this` is the Draggable instance in a non-arrow callback) to prevent it fighting with whatever we do next; (2) read `dragDistance = this.x` (safe since the wrapper always resets to `x:0` after each committed nav, so `this.x` at release IS the total displacement of this gesture) and `velocity = InertiaPlugin.getVelocity(dragWrapperEl, \"x\")`; (3) decide advance vs. snap-back; (4) run our own explicit `gsap.to(...)` for whichever outcome, never both, never relying on the native tween we just killed.\n- `node_modules/.pnpm/@gsap+react@2.1.2.../types/index.d.ts`: `useGSAP(func?: (context, contextSafe) => void | Function, config?: { scope?: ReactRef | Element | string, dependencies?: unknown[], revertOnUpdate?: boolean })`. It's a `useLayoutEffect`-based drop-in that wraps a `gsap.context()` and reverts it on unmount/dependency change.\n- Confirmed via grep of `Draggable.js` (line ~2623, inside the constructor: `_context(_assertThisInitialized(_this2))` where `_context = gsap.core.context`): Draggable instances self-register with whatever `gsap.context()` is currently active at creation time. This means `Draggable.create()` calls made inside `useGSAP`'s callback ARE auto-tracked and auto-`revert()`-ed (which kills them) on unmount — confirmed, not assumed. An explicit `.kill()` cleanup as a backstop is still fine/cheap but is technically redundant; note this clearly in the plan so whoever implements it doesn't think it's load-bearing.\n\n## Decisions already made (carry these into the plan verbatim, they are not open questions)\n\n- Advance-vs-snap-back decision uses OR logic on two independent thresholds (distance OR velocity) — a fast short flick must count as intentional even if total distance is small, matching real inertia UX.\n- Direction mapping must match the OLD handler's convention: old code did `diff = startX - currentX; if (diff > 0) goNext() else goPrev()` — i.e. dragging left (pointer moves left, diff > 0) → `goNext()`. In Draggable's `x` terms (dragging left → `x` goes negative, since the element follows the pointer 1:1), that's `x < 0 → goNext()`, `x > 0 → goPrev()`. Get this sign right — it's easy to invert.\n- Proposed starting constants (named, not magic numbers, matching the file's existing `SCREAMING_SNAKE_WITH_UNIT` convention like `AUTO_PLAY_INTERVAL_MS`): `DRAG_BOUNDS_PX = 140` (rubber-band range), `DRAG_EDGE_RESISTANCE = 0.65`, `DRAG_ADVANCE_DISTANCE_PX = 90`, `DRAG_ADVANCE_VELOCITY_PX_S = 550`, `DRAG_EXIT_DISTANCE_PX = 420` (off-screen fling distance, deliberately larger than bounds so the payoff tween visibly travels), `DRAG_EXIT_DURATION_S = 0.28`, `DRAG_SNAP_BACK_DURATION_S = 0.35`. These are starting points the user will tune by feel — flag them as such, don't present them as final.\n- On advance: tween `dragWrapperRef.current`'s `x` to `±DRAG_EXIT_DISTANCE_PX` (sign matches drag direction) over `DRAG_EXIT_DURATION_S`, eased (e.g. `power2.in`), `onComplete`: synchronously `gsap.set(dragWrapperRef.current, { x: 0 })` THEN call `goNext()`/`goPrev()` — the reset must land before/same-tick-as Framer's card swap becomes visible, or the new card will appear offset by leftover drag transform.\n- On non-advance: explicit `gsap.to(dragWrapperRef.current, { x: 0, duration: DRAG_SNAP_BACK_DURATION_S, ease: \"power3.out\" })` (per the sequencing finding above — do not rely on native bounds springback for this case, it won't reliably land at 0).\n- Gate the entire `Draggable.create(...)` call behind `!prefersReducedMotion` — when reduced motion is preferred, no Draggable instance is created at all (buttons/keyboard remain available).\n- Need a new ref for `useGSAP`'s `scope` option (the `<section>` has no ref today) — add one, e.g. `sectionRef`, and put it on the `<section>` element.\n- Remove `onMouseEnter={pauseAutoPlay}` and `onFocus={pauseAutoPlay}` from the `<section>` (autoplay bug root cause #1).\n- Remove `AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX` constant and its usage; autoplay interval should do `setCurrentIndex((prev) => (prev + 1) % safeProjects.length)` matching `goNext()`'s existing modulo pattern (autoplay bug root cause #2).\n- Remove all six drag handlers, `dragRef`, and all six corresponding on* props on `<section>` — Draggable handles mouse+touch natively, no separate touch path needed.\n\n## Test file that WILL break and must be updated (not deleted) in the same change\n\n`src/components/__tests__/codebase-cleanup-preservation.test.ts`, a `describe(\"ProjectsSlider animation variants are correctly defined\", ...)` block that does raw `readFileSync` + `expect(content).toContain(...)` string-containment checks against the `.tsx` source (no rendering, no jsdom event simulation — just substring assertions). Lines 191-196, the specific test that breaks:\n```ts\nit(\"supports touch/drag gestures\", () => {\n  expect(content).toContain(\"handleTouchStart\");\n  expect(content).toContain(\"handleTouchMove\");\n  expect(content).toContain(\"handleTouchEnd\");\n  expect(content).toContain(\"handleMouseDown\");\n});\n```\nThis will fail once those four identifiers are deleted. Other tests in the same file (spring transition literals, `AnimatePresence`, `mode=\"wait\"`, aria-labels, etc.) must keep passing unchanged — don't touch the slideVariants object or aria-label strings. Two other test files (`icon-button-accessibility.test.ts`, `project-card-content.test.ts`) also do source-string assertions against this component but check unrelated things (aria-labels, content field usage) that this refactor doesn't touch — should be unaffected, but the plan should say to run the full suite to confirm.\n\n## What the plan needs to produce\n\nA concrete, ordered implementation plan for editing `ProjectsSlider.tsx` (imports to add, exact plugin registration call, new refs, the new wrapper div's exact placement in JSX relative to `centerFloatRef`'s div and `<CometCard>`, the `useGSAP` call's shape including which effects/callbacks go inside it, exactly what gets deleted, the two autoplay fixes), plus the specific rewrite for the \"supports touch/drag gestures\" test so it asserts on the NEW implementation instead (e.g. asserting presence of `Draggable`, `InertiaPlugin`, `onDragEnd`, or whatever exact identifiers the plan settles on — keep the replacement assertions consistent with whatever function/variable names the plan actually specifies). Also include the verification checklist (tsc, biome, vitest, build, then manual dev-server test of flick/snap-back/autoplay-full-cycle/no-permanent-stall-on-mouse-drift) as a final section, and end with a note that the constants above should be reported back to the user for tuning once implemented.\n\nKeep the plan tightly scoped to this one file (plus the one test file). Do not propose touching any other file. Do not propose new dependencies (gsap/Draggable/InertiaPlugin/@gsap/react are all already installed). Do not propose an abstraction/hook extraction for this drag logic — it's a single-component, single-use interaction; keep it inline in `ProjectsSlider.tsx` per the codebase's existing style (other GSAP usage in this repo, per Providers.tsx, is also inline)."}`

# ProjectsSlider: GSAP Draggable + Inertia migration, autoplay fix

## Context

`src/components/three/ProjectsSlider.tsx` currently drives its drag-to-navigate interaction with hand-rolled mouse/touch handlers (`dragRef` + six `handle*` functions) that offer no visual feedback while dragging and no momentum on release — just a binary 50px threshold. The task replaces this with real GSAP `Draggable` + `InertiaPlugin` physics (both already installed, no new dependency), while leaving the existing Framer Motion slide transition (`AnimatePresence`/`slideVariants`) and the `goNext()`/`goPrev()` hand-off functions completely untouched.

Two other things are already-diagnosed and get fixed in the same pass since they touch the same file: autoplay currently caps at the first 3 projects (`AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX`) instead of cycling all of them, and it gets perpetually re-paused by `onMouseEnter`/`onFocus` firing on the whole section on any ambient mouse movement, not just deliberate interaction.

All current-state facts below (line numbers, exact handler bodies, hook contracts) were confirmed by reading the actual files, not assumed. The GSAP mechanics (plugin API, callback timing, context auto-tracking) were confirmed by reading the installed package's type defs and source directly — see "Verified GSAP mechanics" below, this is the part most likely to go wrong if done from memory.

## Why the DOM needs a new wrapper div

Two existing systems already own transforms on the elements around the center card, and GSAP Draggable must not collide with either:

- `useSpaceFloat` (`src/hooks/use-space-float.ts`) writes `centerFloatRef`'s wrapper's `el.style.transform` directly, every frame, via a shared site-wide rAF ticker independent of React render — attaching Draggable here would fight it every frame.
- `CometCard` (`src/components/ui/comet-card.tsx`)'s actual root is an inner `motion.div` whose `style.transform` (rotateX/rotateY/translateX/translateY) is driven by Framer motion values for the tilt-on-hover effect — attaching Draggable here would fight Framer over the same CSS property.

Fix: insert a new, plain `<div ref={dragWrapperRef}>` between the two, owned exclusively by Draggable. Three elements, three transform-owning systems, never conflicting — this extends the exact composition pattern `use-space-float.ts`'s own doc comment already establishes for `CometCard` composition.

## Verified GSAP mechanics (read from installed `gsap@3.15.0` / `@gsap/react@2.1.2` source, not memory)

- `Draggable.Vars` (from `node_modules/gsap/types/Draggable.d.ts`) includes `type`, `bounds` (`{minX,maxX,minY,maxY}`), `edgeResistance`, `inertia: boolean`, and callbacks `onDragStart`, `onDragEnd`, `onRelease`. Instance readonly props: `x`, `y`, `tween` (currently-active tween).
- `InertiaPlugin.getVelocity(target: Element, props: string): number` requires the property to have been tracked via `.track()` first — but Draggable calls `InertiaPlugin.track(target, "x,y")` internally on press (confirmed via grep of `Draggable.js`), so `getVelocity` works inside Draggable callbacks with zero manual setup.
- **Critical sequencing** (read directly from `Draggable.js`'s internal `onRelease` handler, ~line 2144-2160): on release, GSAP calls `animate(vars.inertia)` — which starts the native inertia throw as `self.tween` — **before** dispatching `"dragend"` (the `onDragEnd` callback). So by the time our `onDragEnd` runs, a native throw tween is already animating `x`. That native throw only clamps to `bounds` on overshoot; it does **not** snap back to `x: 0` on its own. Relying on it for the "snap back to center" case would leave the card resting off-center. So `onDragEnd` must: (1) kill `this.tween` immediately, (2) decide advance-vs-not itself from `this.x` and `InertiaPlugin.getVelocity(...)`, (3) drive the outcome with our own explicit `gsap.to(...)` — never both a native and custom tween running at once.
- `useGSAP(callback, { scope, dependencies, revertOnUpdate })` (from `@gsap/react`'s type defs) wraps a `gsap.context()` and reverts it on unmount/dependency change.
- Draggable instances self-register with the ambient `gsap.context()` at creation (confirmed via grep: `_context(this)` inside the constructor, where `_context = gsap.core.context`). So `Draggable.create()` calls made inside `useGSAP`'s callback are already auto-killed by `useGSAP`'s revert — **no manual `.kill()` cleanup is needed**, and none should be added (would be redundant, don't let the implementation "fix" a non-issue).
- Direction convention must match the deleted handlers: old code did `diff = startX - currentX; diff > 0 → goNext()` (drag left → next). In Draggable's `x` terms, dragging left makes `x` negative, so: `x < 0 → goNext()`, `x > 0 → goPrev()`.

This repo already uses the `gsap.registerPlugin(useGSAP, ...)` + `useGSAP({ scope, ... })` pattern in `src/components/sections/SkillsSectionClient.tsx` (confirmed by reading it) — follow that same shape.

## Implementation — `src/components/three/ProjectsSlider.tsx` only

1. **Imports** (near line 1-12): add
   ```ts
   import { useGSAP } from "@gsap/react";
   import gsap from "gsap";
   import { Draggable } from "gsap/Draggable";
   import { InertiaPlugin } from "gsap/InertiaPlugin";
   ```
   Leave `motion/react`, `CometCard`, `useSpaceFloat` imports untouched.

2. **Register plugins**, module scope, right after imports:
   ```ts
   gsap.registerPlugin(useGSAP, Draggable, InertiaPlugin);
   ```

3. **Constants** (currently lines 153-155): remove `AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX`; add, next to the existing autoplay constants, using the file's existing naming convention:
   ```ts
   const DRAG_BOUNDS_PX = 140;
   const DRAG_EDGE_RESISTANCE = 0.65;
   const DRAG_ADVANCE_DISTANCE_PX = 90;
   const DRAG_ADVANCE_VELOCITY_PX_S = 550;
   const DRAG_EXIT_DISTANCE_PX = 420;
   const DRAG_EXIT_DURATION_S = 0.28;
   const DRAG_SNAP_BACK_DURATION_S = 0.35;
   ```
   These are starting points for the user to tune by feel — report them back at the end, don't present as final.

4. **Refs** (currently line 182 has `dragRef`): delete `dragRef`; add
   ```ts
   const sectionRef = useRef<HTMLElement | null>(null);
   const dragWrapperRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);
   ```

5. **Delete the six drag handlers** (currently lines 278-307 — `handleMouseDown/Move/Up`, `handleTouchStart/Move/End`) entirely.

6. **Add a `useGSAP` block**, placed after the existing `useEffect`s (after the resume-timer cleanup effect, before the `if (!safeProjects.length)` early return):
   ```ts
   useGSAP(
     () => {
       if (prefersReducedMotion) return;
       const wrapper = dragWrapperRef.current;
       if (!wrapper) return;

       Draggable.create(wrapper, {
         type: "x",
         bounds: { minX: -DRAG_BOUNDS_PX, maxX: DRAG_BOUNDS_PX },
         edgeResistance: DRAG_EDGE_RESISTANCE,
         inertia: true,
         onDragStart: () => {
           pauseAutoPlay();
         },
         onDragEnd() {
           this.tween?.kill();

           const dragDistance = this.x;
           const velocity = InertiaPlugin.getVelocity(wrapper, "x");
           const advance =
             Math.abs(dragDistance) > DRAG_ADVANCE_DISTANCE_PX ||
             Math.abs(velocity) > DRAG_ADVANCE_VELOCITY_PX_S;

           if (!advance) {
             gsap.to(wrapper, {
               x: 0,
               duration: DRAG_SNAP_BACK_DURATION_S,
               ease: "power3.out",
             });
             return;
           }

           const goingNext = dragDistance < 0;
           gsap.to(wrapper, {
             x: goingNext ? -DRAG_EXIT_DISTANCE_PX : DRAG_EXIT_DISTANCE_PX,
             duration: DRAG_EXIT_DURATION_S,
             ease: "power2.in",
             onComplete: () => {
               gsap.set(wrapper, { x: 0 });
               if (goingNext) goNext();
               else goPrev();
             },
           });
         },
       });
     },
     { scope: sectionRef, dependencies: [prefersReducedMotion], revertOnUpdate: true },
   );
   ```
   `onDragEnd` must be a plain `function`, not an arrow function, so `this` is the Draggable instance (needed for `this.tween`, `this.x`). No manual `.kill()` cleanup — see "Verified GSAP mechanics" above.

7. **Center-card JSX** (currently lines 376-398): insert the new wrapper div between `centerFloatRef`'s div and `<CometCard>`:
   ```tsx
   <div ref={centerFloatRef as React.RefObject<HTMLDivElement>} style={centerFloatStyle} className="flex-1 min-w-0">
     <div ref={dragWrapperRef} className="touch-none">
       <CometCard rotateDepth={3} translateDepth={5}>
         {/* unchanged: AnimatePresence / motion.div / ProjectCard */}
       </CometCard>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```
   `touch-none` (→ `touch-action: none`) stops the browser's native touch-scroll from fighting Draggable's touch handling on mobile — a one-line necessity alongside GSAP Draggable, not in the original spec but cheap and standard.

8. **`<section>` element** (currently lines 324-336): remove all eight `on*` props (`onMouseDown/Move/Up/Leave`, `onTouchStart/Move/End`, `onMouseEnter={pauseAutoPlay}`, `onFocus={pauseAutoPlay}`); add `ref={sectionRef as React.RefObject<HTMLElement>}`:
   ```tsx
   <section
     ref={sectionRef as React.RefObject<HTMLElement>}
     aria-label="Projects carousel"
     className="relative"
   >
   ```

9. **Autoplay fix** (currently line 266): change
   ```ts
   setCurrentIndex((prev) => (prev + 1) % AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX);
   ```
   to
   ```ts
   setCurrentIndex((prev) => (prev + 1) % safeProjects.length);
   ```
   matching `goNext()`'s existing modulo pattern (line 215). Nothing else in that effect changes — same `setInterval`, same `AUTO_PLAY_INTERVAL_MS`, same `prefersReducedMotion || autoPlayPaused` guard.

## Test file update — `src/components/__tests__/codebase-cleanup-preservation.test.ts`

The `"supports touch/drag gestures"` test (lines 191-196) does raw string-containment checks against the source for `handleTouchStart`/`handleTouchMove`/`handleTouchEnd`/`handleMouseDown` — all four are being deleted, so this test would break. Update it (don't delete it) to assert on the new implementation instead:

```ts
it("supports drag gestures via GSAP Draggable", () => {
  expect(content).toContain("Draggable");
  expect(content).toContain("InertiaPlugin");
  expect(content).toContain("onDragEnd");
  expect(content).toContain("dragWrapperRef");
});
```

No other test in this file or in `icon-button-accessibility.test.ts` / `project-card-content.test.ts` needs changes — they check `slideVariants` literals, `AnimatePresence`/`mode="wait"`, aria-labels, and content-field usage, none of which this refactor touches. Run the full suite to confirm.

## Verification

Run in order, fix on first failure:

1. `pnpm typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) — confirms `Draggable`/`InertiaPlugin` types resolve and `this.tween`/`this.x` typing in `onDragEnd` is correct.
2. `pnpm exec biome check --write src/components/three/ProjectsSlider.tsx` — catches import ordering and any leftover reference to the deleted `dragRef`/handlers.
3. `pnpm test` (`vitest run`, full suite) — confirms the rewritten drag-gesture test passes and nothing else regressed.
4. `pnpm build` — confirms production build succeeds.
5. Manual check with `pnpm dev`:
   - Fast flick left → card visibly travels with momentum and lands cleanly on the next project, no offset "pop" at the Framer hand-off.
   - Fast flick right → same, previous project.
   - Small/slow drag (under both thresholds) → springs back cleanly to center, no navigation.
   - Side "ghost" cards, pagination dots, and the tether flash effect all still work unchanged.
   - Let autoplay run past project index 3 with 4+ projects seeded → confirms it no longer stalls at the old `AUTO_PLAY_MAX_INDEX` cap.
   - Move the mouse around near (not on) the slider without dragging it → autoplay keeps advancing, confirming the perpetual-pause bug is gone.
   - Toggle OS "reduce motion" → no `Draggable` instance is created; buttons/keyboard nav still work.

Report the seven `DRAG_*` constant values back to the user once implemented, for feel-tuning.
