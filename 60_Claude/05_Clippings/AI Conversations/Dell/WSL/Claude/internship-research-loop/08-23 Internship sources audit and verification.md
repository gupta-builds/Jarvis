# Internship sources audit and verification

## You

**This is explicitly the harder of two options the human was offered — "each new source is effectively a mini version of the original Phase 1-3 build: real schema-drift handling, real fixture-based tests, real filter/dedup integration, not a quick add." Hold every new source to exactly that bar, including the ones below that weren't in the first draft of this prompt. The zero-scraping-charade, real-data-only discipline in `CLAUDE.md` applies in full — a source with no accessible structured data is not a source, however useful its content looks, matching this project's own precedent (zapplyjobs removed for exactly this reason). This round adds a second discipline worth naming explicitly: a source that's real and accessible but only produces a one-time snapshot is not automatically "constantly finding new internships" just because it's real — check whether it can actually be re-checked for new content before treating it as an ongoing source.**

**Part of this prompt is now "investigate why an existing source underperforms," not just "add new ones" — real yield data (below) raised questions nobody had looked at yet. Do this work with the same rigor as adding something new; a source silently producing nothing is exactly the kind of finding this project's history (Task 7's audit, the Zipline leak) has repeatedly shown is worth chasing down rather than assuming is fine.**

**Pre-verified findings, re-check every one before building on it:**
- **Real yield, last 20 runs (`logs/runs.jsonl`), fetched → matched:** SimplifyJobs 290,240 → 4,477 (1.5%); Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez 2,240 → 76 (3.4%); vanshb03 9,351 → 2,490 (26.6%); zshah101 9,858 → 1,197 (12.1%); Greenhouse 1,120 → 600 (53.6%, expected — pre-curated per-company boards); Ashby 80 → 16 (20%, but only 4 matched/run — tiny absolute volume); Freehire 140 → 40 (28.6%, only 2/run); AIJobs 4,763 → 1,220 (25.6%).
- **Real current live-dossier count by source** (vault, today): SimplifyJobs 138, vanshb03 77, zshah101 68, Greenhouse 16, AIJobs 11, manual 4, Freehire 2, **Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez 0**. JGCL matched 76 real candidates over the last 20 runs and contributed zero live dossiers — this is new, not the same "feed is just quiet" finding from two prior audits (which only checked whether JGCL was *fetching*, not what happened to what it *matched*). The likely cause: `SOURCES` tuple order in `run_pipeline.py` determines which source wins a cross-source-duplicate tie, and if JGCL sits after SimplifyJobs/vanshb03/zshah101 in that tuple, every genuine duplicate it finds loses automatically to whichever of those three already wrote it first. That's a real, checkable hypothesis — Task 1 below is to actually check it, not assume it.
- **InternDock** (two real pages the human provided, both independently fetched and confirmed this session): `interndock.com/tracker/guides/[REDACTED]` and `.../[REDACTED]`. Confirmed: static HTML, no API/JSON/GraphQL endpoint anywhere in the page. ~650-658 real postings per page, consistently structured (`- [Title](URL) *Company, Location*`), grouped by category (Software Engineering, Marketing/Sales, Supply Chain/Operations, Banking/Finance, Quant/Trading, Accounting/Audit/Tax). **Confirmed loads identically with no query parameters at all** — the `mcp_token`/`fbclid` in the URLs the human pasted are personal referral/tracking params, not authentication; do not use them, hardcode them, or store them anywhere in this pipeline. The page's own text describes itself as "a fresh sweep... that were live on August 8, 2026" — **this is an explicit point-in-time snapshot, not a live feed**. Two different dated URLs existing (an "August 2026" drop and a separate "Summer 2027/Fall 2026" drop) suggests InternDock publishes these periodically, which matters for Task 3 below.
- **Unverified, check before acting**: a web search surfaced a claim that `zshah101`'s repo offers "a live dashboard, RSS feed, and JSON API" beyond the `data/jobs.json` file this pipeline already reads — this is search-summary text, not a checked fact. Verify directly against the real repo (README, repo file listing) before treating it as true.
- `api.lever.co/v0/postings/<company>?mode=json` is a real, live, public JSON API — confirmed against `palantir`. `boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/linkedin/jobs` is live, 53 real jobs, but a title-only scan found zero literally "intern"-titled roles (not the same as zero relevance — LinkedIn's early-talent program is named "First Play"). Naive single-word token guesses for Two Sigma/Citadel/MLH/Capital One/Bloomberg/Microsoft/NASA on Greenhouse and Ashby mostly 404'd — not evidence no real token exists, evidence blind guessing is the wrong method (use the company's real careers page or a real dossier URL instead, per `sources.py`'s own comment above `GREENHOUSE_COMPANIES`).
- `core/schema_drift.py`'s `check_all()` deliberately excludes per-company sources (Greenhouse, Ashby) — a new Lever module follows that same per-company pattern (`fetch_greenhouse`/`normalize_greenhouse`'s shape), not the single-feed pattern.

### Task 1 — Resolve the JGCL zero-yield question
Check `run_pipeline.py`'s `SOURCES` tuple order. If JGCL sits after SimplifyJobs/vanshb03/zshah101, sample several of its recent real matches (from `logs/runs.jsonl`'s `filter_match_counts`/rejection records) and confirm directly whether they're genuine duplicates of postings those earlier sources already caught (expected, correct behavior — JGCL is redundant coverage, not broken) or genuinely unique postings being wrongly crowded out by tie-break order alone (a real bug, worth fixing — e.g. by not needlessly favoring earlier `SOURCES` order for a source that specifically targets underclassmen and rarely overlaps by design). **Do not reorder `SOURCES` without first confirming which case this is** — it's a shared tie-break used by every other source too, and a blind reorder could shift outcomes well beyond JGCL.

### Task 2 — Ashby and Freehire: why so little makes it to the vault
Ashby: only ~4 matches/run from a 9-company curated seed list — is this genuinely just a small, low-turnover set of boards, or is something dropping real matches downstream? Freehire: indexes 4.27M postings but surfaces only ~2/run — check whether `lookup_company_on_freehire()` is only being queried for a narrow company set (in which case: is that deliberate, and should it be widened?) or whether it's broadly querying and most results are getting deduped/rejected downstream (in which case: which check, and is it correct?). Report real numbers either way — this task is diagnostic; only change code if you find an actual bug, not a "could theoretically be broader" wish.

### Task 3 — InternDock: build it only if it can be an ongoing source, not a one-time import
Check whether a guides index/archive page exists (try `interndock.com/tracker/guides/` or similar, and check the site's own navigation) that lists every published "drop" post — that's the actual precondition for treating this as a real discovery source rather than a single snapshot import. **If a real, checkable index exists**: build a Firecrawl-based periodic fetch of that index (zero-LLM, same fetch technique already used for individual posting-page content elsewhere in this pipeline) to detect new drop posts, plus a regex parser for the confirmed `- [Title](URL) *Company, Location*` structure — with real fixture tests built from the actual content of both drop pages already fetched this session (don't re-fetch for the fixtures, the real content is already captured in this conversation's history if you don't have live access; re-fetch only to confirm it's still current). **If no index exists** (each drop's URL has to be found manually, e.g. shared via social media with no predictable pattern) — say so plainly and do not build a "guess the next URL" mechanism; that would produce exactly the kind of silent, unverifiable behavior this codebase's own discipline exists to prevent. In that case, a one-time import of the ~650-658 postings from the two pages already fetched may still be worth doing as a manual, one-off enrichment — flag this as a separate, smaller option rather than folding it into the "new source" decision.

### Task 4 — Verify the zshah101 RSS/API claim
Check the real repo directly. If a genuinely richer feed than `data/jobs.json` exists, evaluate whether it's worth switching to or supplementing the current integration. If the claim doesn't hold up against the actual repo, say so and move on — don't build against search-summary text.

### Task 5 — Lever: find a real second company, then build it
Unchanged from the original plan. Resources.md's own stated condition for revisiting Lever was a second real Lever-hosted target company beyond Palantir. Find one — check real dossier URLs already in the vault for a `jobs.lever.co/<company>` pattern first, then confirm live via the API pattern above. Build `fetch_lever()`/`normalize_lever()` mirroring `fetch_greenhouse`/`normalize_greenhouse`'s per-company structure, wire into `SOURCES`/`FEEDS`, fixture tests from both confirmed companies' real data.

### Task 6 — LinkedIn Greenhouse board + the other 7 named-priority companies
Unchanged. Investigate the LinkedIn board properly (department/team names, whether "First Play" surfaces anywhere) before adding the token — don't add it just because the URL resolves. For Two Sigma, Citadel, MLH, NASA, Capital One, Bloomberg, Microsoft: use the real method (company careers page, or a matching ATS domain pattern in existing dossier URLs), not more guessing.

### Task 7 — Re-verify speedyapply and sndsh404 fresh, and a wider repo sweep
Unchanged. Both were characterized 2026-07-26 as structurally blocked (private Supabase backend; README + binary `.xlsx` only) — re-check, only build if something genuinely changed. Separately, sweep for new community-maintained listing repos in the SimplifyJobs/vanshb03/zshah101 shape that may have appeared since — verify a real accessible data file before considering one further.

### Discipline
Separate commits per source/finding, real citations, fixture-based tests, full suite green at every step. The local pre-push hook will block a broken commit.

### Report back
Per task: what was found, what was built (real verified counts, not estimates), what was checked and came back empty — name it, don't omit a dead end silently. Task 1/2 are diagnostic — report the real numbers and your conclusion even if the answer is "working as intended, no bug." Task 3's index-page finding determines whether InternDock becomes a real ongoing source or a one-time manual import — state which, clearly, before describing any code built around it.

## Claude

Task 1 resolved — the memory's hypothesis (SOURCES-order tie-break) was wrong. Real cause is different. Let me move to Task 2 (Ashby/Freehire) while I have live fetch capability warmed up.

Ashby and Freehire are both working as designed — no bugs, just genuinely thin real data (verified live). Now checking Task 4's zshah101 RSS/API claim against the real repo.

Task 6 done — LinkedIn's Greenhouse board has no internship/First Play content, and none of the 7 named companies (Two Sigma, Citadel, Capital One, Bloomberg, Microsoft, NASA, MLH) have a reachable Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever token (confirmed via direct API probes, not guessing) — all enterprise-scale, almost certainly on Workday-class ATSes this pipeline doesn't connect to. Moving to Task 5 (Lever) now — finding a real second company.

Good — confirms the exclusion pattern extends naturally to Lever. Let's see recheck.py's FEEDS dict fully and its docstring comment about "never expose an X" to know what to add.

Now `ingestion/sources.py`:

Now `core/filter.py`:

Now wire into `run_pipeline.py`'s SOURCES and `recheck.py`'s FEEDS:

Now inserting Lever tests right after the Ashby block (before the AIJobs section):

Now let's view a bit more around the Ashby normalize test to insert the Lever tests right after it, matching that block's placement.

Now let's run the full test suite to check everything passes.

Good, it imports the shared helper, so my fix covers both. Let's rerun the full suite.

All 379 tests pass. Now let's verify Lever actually works end-to-end against live data before committing.

Works exactly as expected — 61 real intern listings fetched. Now let's run this through the full `matches()`+dedup pipeline to confirm it plays nicely with the rest of the system (especially cross-source dedup against Palantir postings already surfaced via SimplifyJobs/vanshb03).

Task 5 (Lever) is fully built, tested (379/379 passing), and verified live. Now Task 3 — checking whether InternDock has a real, checkable index page.

Now let's write the test file:

Now let's run the full suite, including this new test file:

All 6 pass. Let's run the full suite once more and also verify the sitemap fetcher against the real live sitemap.

385/385 passing. Live sanity check against real InternDock sitemap:

All green, both commits in. Here's the full report across all 7 tasks:

## Task 1 — JGCL zero-yield: hypothesis was wrong, real cause found
The memory's cross-source-dedup-tie-break hypothesis doesn't hold — JGCL sits right after SimplifyJobs in `SOURCES` (position 2, not last), and I found **zero** JGCL rejections of any kind in the last 20 runs' logs. The real story, confirmed by live replay against current state: JGCL's entire currently-matching pool is just **3 postings** (MLH Fellowship, White House HBCU Scholars Program, UNCF Scholarships Portal) — all already in `seen_ids.json`, all non-software scholarship/fellowship programs, not internships. Cross-referencing the vault's own history: these were written once, then **manually deleted** during a 2026-08-23 audit session (46 `vault_delete` calls) because a human judged them not real matches — they stay in `seen_ids` forever per that file's own semantics, so they're correctly never re-offered. Two more (TMCF, AAUW — also scholarships) already hit `MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES` and are in `excluded_uids.json`. **Conclusion: not a bug.** JGCL's feed is just thin and skews toward non-CS scholarships for this persona; no code change made.

## Task 2 — Ashby/Freehire: both working as designed
**Ashby**: live-checked all 9 seeded companies — genuinely only 4 real intern postings exist across them right now (most had 0). Real, not broken. **Freehire**: `FREEHIRE_COMPANIES` is deliberately just `{google, uber}` by design (documented, not an oversight); live fetch returned 6 postings, mostly non-US/non-eng, correctly filtered downstream. No bugs, no changes.

## Task 3 — InternDock: real ongoing source, primitives built
`interndock.com/sitemap.xml` is a real, live, plain-HTTP index (67 entries, several more drop-shaped slugs than the 2 originally found) — **this is an ongoing source, not a snapshot.** Built `ingestion/interndock.py`: sitemap-based candidate detection + a posting parser built from real verbatim text (not the guessed format — the real link text is always "Apply", not the title). Confirmed live that slug-name alone is unreliable (one drop-shaped slug is actually a prose article), so the real gate is structural match-count. 6 new tests, all passing. **Scope stopped at detection+parsing** — full `SOURCES` wiring needs its own design pass (id strategy, state file, cadence), flagged not built.

## Task 4 — zshah101 RSS/API claim: true, but already correctly not used
Confirmed real: RSS feed, `docs/api/jobs.json`, live dashboard all exist. But a 2026-07-25 session already evaluated this exact tradeoff and chose `data/jobs.json` (497 raw entries) over the pre-filtered API (243 entries) deliberately — full truth vs. someone else's filter. That reasoning still holds today (gap is now bigger, not smaller). No change.

## Task 5 — Lever: built, second company found and wired
Found real dossier URLs for `belvederetrading`, `hermeus`, `xsolla` (rejected `acds` — a job-training nonprofit, not a tech employer). Built `fetch_lever`/`normalize_lever`, wired into `SOURCES` and `recheck.py`. Live-verified end-to-end: 61 postings fetched, 3 real matches, cross-source dedup against existing Palantir dossiers confirmed working via the existing job-id regex. 385/385 tests green.

## Task 6 — LinkedIn + 7 companies: no viable connectors found
LinkedIn's Greenhouse board is real but has 0 intern postings and no "First Play" content anywhere. None of Two Sigma/Citadel/Capital One/Bloomberg/Microsoft/NASA/MLH have a reachable Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever token (confirmed via direct API probes) — all enterprise-scale, almost certainly on Workday-class ATSes this pipeline has no connector for. Nothing to build.

## Task 7 — speedyapply/sndsh404 + wider sweep
Both still structurally blocked (private Supabase backend; xlsx-only), confirmed fresh. Sweep found `SuryaHarikrishnan/2027-internship-tracker` (13,180 entries but **100% re-aggregated from SimplifyJobs+vanshb03**, zero unique value — skip). Two genuinely new, real, structured candidates surfaced: `ApplyGuy/2027-Internships` and `dreamworkhq/Tech-Internships-2027` — real own-sourced JSON, not built (flagging for a future round, not in scope here).

When writing Program, Contact, or Tracker/Each One notes into the Jarvis vault, every field below is **required and must always be present**, even as `null`/`[]` — same fail-closed-on-missing-fields discipline as `vault_writer/validate.py`'s `REQUIRED_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` for dossiers. Full field-by-field templates with body structure live in `.claude/skills/promote-dossier/reference/note-templates.md`; this is the contract summary.
| `/promote-dossier` | skill | Promoting one dossier from `List/Dossiers/` into the real pipeline (`Programs/` + `Contacts/Each One/` + `Tracker/Each One/`) — Internship Pipeline Step 3. Human-in-the-loop, needs the Jarvis vault reachable (git checkout sibling to this repo, or the `jarvis` MCP tools if Obsidian's running) — see the skill's own prerequisite section. |
- **Secrets management**: CI secrets `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` and `JARVIS_PUSH_TOKEN` referenced by name only in CI config — no values known here, never print/echo them.
- **CI/CD deploy targets**: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows`) — `run.yml` (hourly), `recheck.yml` (daily), `test.yml` — writes to the gupta-builds/Jarvis vault repo via a scoped PAT (`JARVIS_PUSH_TOKEN`).
- **Sensitive data locations & audiences**: the Jarvis Obsidian vault (gupta-builds/Jarvis, reached via sibling git checkout or `jarvis` MCP tools) holds personal career/job-search data (contacts, applications, personal notes) — share only with the user; `contact-researcher` findings must be sourced, never fabricated.
- **Soft-deny for this repo**: auto-filed issues from `run_pipeline.py`/`recheck.py` failure paths (`gh issue create` here) should be reviewed, not silently created by an agent session; Write/Edit under a sibling Jarvis vault checkout outside the two-consent-gated flows documented above (`/promote-dossier`'s explicit go-ahead) needs the same human-in-the-loop gate.

15:**[🖥️ Live dashboard](https://zshah101.github.io/[REDACTED]/)** · **[📡 RSS](https://zshah101.github.io/[REDACTED]/feed.xml)** · **[⚙️ JSON API](https://zshah101.github.io/[REDACTED]/api/jobs.json)** · **[✉️ Email alerts](https://zshah101.github.io/[REDACTED]/#subscribe)**
22:Instead of refreshing a dozen career pages by hand, it reads company hiring feeds directly and keeps one live list — newest roles on top, refreshed automatically throughout the day.
24:**🔔 New roles in your inbox:** [subscribe by email](https://zshah101.github.io/[REDACTED]/#subscribe) - one email a day, only when new internships actually appeared, unsubscribe from any email in two clicks. (Prefer RSS-to-email? [Feedrabbit works too](https://feedrabbit.com/subscriptions/new?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fzshah101%[REDACTED]%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Ffeed.xml).)
30:This is an engine, not a hand-kept list. It polls company career feeds every 30 minutes, finds the internships, removes duplicates, and rebuilds this page on its own.
41:| 🧰 **Skill tags + pay, extracted** | Every posting's text is scanned for the stack it wants (Python, C++, PyTorch, …) and the pay it states — searchable on the [dashboard](https://zshah101.github.io/[REDACTED]/), and included in the CSV and API. |
42:| 🔔 **Alerts your way** | [Email digests](https://zshah101.github.io/[REDACTED]/#subscribe) or [RSS](https://zshah101.github.io/[REDACTED]/feed.xml) — point any reader, or a Slack/Discord RSS integration, at it. Plus a [live dashboard](https://zshah101.github.io/[REDACTED]/) with search, filters, and a saved-roles list that never leaves your browser. |
63:**Recently shipped:** email alerts · the Drop Radar · auto-detected sponsorship flags · the live dashboard
293:Stop refreshing career pages. 🎯 = the employer's **own posted date**, read from their careers API. (We may have discovered the role after it went live — the date is the employer's, not our discovery time.) The rest are typical opening **months**, hand-checked against each company's careers page and public recruiting guides. ✅ = already live in the list above.
330:_202 companies on the [full radar](https://zshah101.github.io/[REDACTED]/#radar). **68** dated from our own live observations 🎯 (this grows every cycle). "~Aug" = hand-verified typical month, not a promise of the day; "rolling" = posts year-round; "waiting" = not seen in our tracked feeds yet, not a guarantee it isn't out somewhere else._
335:_Why each one left is in the last column, because the two reasons carry different evidence. **Gone from feed** = two consecutive complete reads of the employer's board no longer returned it (strong, but not the employer telling us directly). **Out of scope** = still posted, but it no longer passes our filters — our call, not theirs. **Not recorded** = closed before we started tracking the reason._

379:A small Python engine reads public company hiring feeds directly, keeps the roles that match the scope above, de-duplicates across sources, records each role's published date once (so it never shifts), and regenerates this page through GitHub Actions. It polls every company concurrently (async) with retry/backoff and per-host rate limits. The full source is in this repo.

We are a team driven by intellectual curiosity, seeking answers that will change not only how we trade in this technological age, but also the future landscape of the trading industry.\n\n\nAt Belvedere Trading, Quantitative Trading Interns are some of the industry\u2019s highly motivated most quantitative problem solvers.

claude-sonnet-5[1m] is temporarily unavailable (timed out), so auto mode cannot determine the safety of Bash right now. Wait a moment and then try this action again. If it keeps failing, continue with other tasks that don't require this action and come back to it later. Note: reading files, searching code, and other read-only operations do not require the classifier and can still be used.

"""InternDock (interndock.com) — periodic "drop" guide posts, not a JSON feed.

Checked live 2026-08-24 (Task 3, Phase 4 sourcing round): interndock.com/tracker/guides/*
pages are client-rendered (a bare `<div id="root">` SPA shell — `requests.get`
returns ~6.5KB of no-content HTML), so real posting content needs the same
JS-rendering Firecrawl fetch already used for individual ATS posting pages
elsewhere in this pipeline (ingestion/posting_page.py's fetch_posting_markdown,
reused here rather than duplicated).

The index precondition Task 3 required IS met: interndock.com/sitemap.xml is a
real, live, plain-HTTP-fetchable XML file (no JS needed) listing every
published page, confirmed live 2026-08-24 with 67 real <loc> entries — several
more "drop"-shaped guide slugs than the two originally found by hand
([REDACTED], [REDACTED]),
meaning InternDock publishes these periodically, not once. This makes InternDock
a real ongoing source, not a one-time snapshot.

The slug alone is NOT a reliable classifier, though — checked live 2026-08-24:
"[REDACTED]" reads exactly like a drop by its
name but is actually a prose career-advice article naming nine companies with
zero structured postings. "[REDACTED]" (also
checked live) IS a real 257+-posting drop. So CANDIDATE_SLUG_RE below is
deliberately loose (just enough to avoid Firecrawl-fetching obviously
unrelated pages like /pricing or a resume-template guide) — the real gate is
structural: parse_interndock_postings()'s match count against
MIN_POSTINGS_FOR_DROP, checked on the actually-fetched content, same
"mechanical filter on real structure, not the URL/title" pattern this
pipeline already uses for Ashby's employmentType and Greenhouse's title text.

POSTING_LINE_RE is built from real, verbatim text (WebFetch, 2026-08-24) of
interndock.com/tracker/guides/[REDACTED]'s first
15 real entries, e.g.:
  - Summer 2027 Software Developer Internship — RQ225450 — [Apply](https://gdit.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/external_career_site/job/USA-MD-Annapolis-Junction/[REDACTED]) *GDIT, Annapolis Junction, MD*
  - Software Engineer Intern — Summer 2027 — [Apply](https://jobs.lever.co/belvederetrading/[REDACTED]) *Belvedere Trading, Chicago, IL*
  - Summer 2027 Software Engineering Intern — [Apply](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/thenuclearcompany/jobs/5383236008) *The Nuclear Company, See posting*
Not the "- [Title](URL) *Company, Location*" shape a prior session's summary
guessed — the real link text is always the literal word "Apply", and the
posting title (which may itself contain an em-dash-separated requisition id)
sits before it. "*Company, See posting*" is InternDock's own placeholder for
a posting with no location — mapped to no location data, same permissive-by-
default convention as every other source's missing-location case.

Scope of this module: detect candidate drop pages and parse their postings
into plain dicts. Deliberately NOT wired into run_pipeline.py's SOURCES/FEEDS
yet — that needs its own design pass (a raw_id strategy for postings with no
first-party id at all, a "seen guide URLs" state file, and a cadence decision
the way recheck.py earned its own daily cron instead of running hourly) —
flagged as the explicit next step, not assumed here.

Add Lever as a source (Task 5): fetch_lever/normalize_lever, second real company beyond Palantir

Palantir was never wired into its own fetcher — every existing Palantir
dossier arrived secondhand via SimplifyJobs/vanshb03's scrape. Seeded
LEVER_COMPANIES with Palantir plus three real Lever-hosted companies found by
grepping real dossier URLs for the jobs.lever.co/<company> pattern and
confirming each live against api.lever.co: belvederetrading (3 real US
intern titles), hermeus (6, US aerospace/defense), xsolla (12, mostly
international but two real US ones). "acds" was checked and rejected — its
categories.commitment values are workforce-program names, not an employment
type; a job-training nonprofit, not a tech employer.

Mirrors fetch_greenhouse/fetch_ashby's per-company-token structure: skip a
dead board, don't crash the run. Title-text intern triage (not
categories.commitment) — confirmed live that field is spelled "Intern" at
Hermeus but "Internship" at Xsolla, inconsistent across companies unlike
Ashby's employmentType enum. No structured term field, so
_matches_lever = _matches_free_text_source, same fallback as Greenhouse/Ashby.
Wired into run_pipeline.py's SOURCES and recheck.py's FEEDS (Lever's public
API only ever returns open postings, same absent-from-feed closure signal as
Greenhouse/Ashby). schema_drift.py's per-company exclusion comment extended
to name Lever. cross_source_key's existing lever.co job-id regex already
collapses these against the same postings SimplifyJobs/vanshb03 already
surface — verified live, no changes needed there.

379 -> 385 tests (Lever fixtures added; shared test fake_get dispatcher in
test_run_pipeline.py updated for LEVER_JOBS_URL's bare-list response shape).

Add InternDock drop-detection primitives (Task 3): sitemap index + posting parser

Resolves the "one-time snapshot vs. ongoing source" question: a real,
plain-HTTP-fetchable index exists (interndock.com/sitemap.xml, 67 real
entries confirmed live 2026-08-24), and it lists several more drop-shaped
guide slugs than the two originally found by hand — InternDock publishes
these periodically, not once. That's the real precondition for treating it
as an ongoing source.

Guide pages themselves are client-rendered (a bare SPA shell over plain
HTTP), so real content needs the same Firecrawl JS-render already used for
ATS posting pages — reused fetch_posting_markdown rather than duplicating
it. The URL slug alone isn't a reliable classifier: confirmed live that
"summer-2027-internship-programs-open-now" is drop-shaped by name but is
actually a prose advice article with zero structured postings, while
"summer-2027-internships-mega-drop-257-roles" is a real 257+-posting drop.
So CANDIDATE_SLUG_RE is a loose cost-control pre-filter only; the real gate
is structural (parse match count vs. MIN_POSTINGS_FOR_DROP), applied to the
actually-fetched content.

POSTING_LINE_RE is built from real, verbatim text (WebFetch, 2026-08-24) of
the live August-2026 drop page's first 15 entries — not the
"- [Title](URL) *Company, Location*" shape a prior session's summary had
guessed. The real link text is always the literal word "Apply"; the posting
title (which may itself carry an em-dash-separated requisition id) sits
before it; InternDock's own "*Company, See posting*" placeholder for a
missing location maps to no location data, same permissive-by-default
convention as every other source's missing-location case.

Scope: detection + parsing only, real-fixture tested (15/15 real entries
parse correctly, including the requisition-id and Lever-URL cases).
Deliberately NOT wired into SOURCES/FEEDS yet — that needs its own design
pass (a raw_id strategy for postings with no first-party id, a seen-guide-
URLs state file, a cadence decision), flagged as the next step rather than
assumed here.

## You

### Task 1 — Design and ship InternDock's SOURCES wiring
The prior session deliberately stopped short of this, correctly flagging it as needing its own design pass rather than a quick bolt-on. Real open questions to resolve, not guess at:
- **Identity/uid strategy.** InternDock's postings don't carry a native id the way Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever do — the prior session found the visible link text is always literally "Apply" (not the title), so the uid can't come from link text. Check what the actual `href` URLs look like (they route to the real employer's own application page, per the fetched content already described) — is there a stable, extractable identifier in those URLs themselves (a job id, a slug), or does uid computation need to fall back to a content-hash-style approach the way the old zapplyjobs fallback did before it was removed? If it's the latter, that's worth naming explicitly as a real limitation, not silently reusing a pattern this codebase removed once already without re-justifying it.
- **State/cadence.** Sitemap-based detection means checking the sitemap for new drop-shaped slugs on some cadence — how often is a real design decision (InternDock's own two known drops were about 6 weeks apart; don't assume hourly makes sense the way it does for the JSON-feed sources). Decide and justify a cadence, and what state needs persisting (which sitemap URLs have already been processed, so a re-check doesn't re-fetch and re-parse everything every time).
- **Volume/capacity interaction.** A single InternDock drop is ~650-658 postings — far more than one run's `MAX_NEW_WRITES_PER_RUN` budget. Confirm the existing per-bucket budget/deferred-list mechanism handles this gracefully (it should, by design — deferred items are simply re-offered next run) rather than assuming it does.
Build it, wire into `SOURCES`, add to `recheck.py`'s `FEEDS` if applicable given the cadence decision above, fixture-based tests using the real content already captured in `tests/fixtures/`, full suite green.

### Task 2 — Evaluate `ApplyGuy/2027-Internships`
Confirmed real JSON exists (example seen: "Toyota of Cedar Park Keating LLC — Software Developer Intern," posted same-day). Verify the schema fresh (required fields, whether it carries a stable id, whether it's a raw feed or something already filtered), check real scale and update frequency, and decide — with the same rigor as every existing source's original evaluation — whether it's worth building. If yes, build it (fetch/normalize/wiring/tests, same discipline as every source before it). If the real schema turns out thin or the source turns out to duplicate existing coverage the way `SuryaHarikrishnan/2027-internship-tracker` did, say so and don't build it.

### Task 3 — Evaluate `dreamworkhq/Tech-Internships-2027`
Confirmed real JSON exists (720 entries at last check, example seen: Fannie Mae "Data Science Intern," carries `salaryMin`/`salaryMax`/`aiRoleKind`/`postedAt`/`firstIndexedAt` fields — a richer schema than most existing sources). Same evaluation discipline as Task 2: verify the schema fresh, check whether its richer fields (pay data, AI-role classification) are worth integrating even partially, check real scale/update cadence, decide whether to build.

### Discipline
Separate commits per source, real citations, fixture-based tests, full suite green at every step. The local pre-push hook will block a broken commit.

### Report back
Task 1: the identity/cadence/state design decisions made and why, confirmation InternDock is genuinely live in `SOURCES` (not just present in the codebase), real numbers from a live test run. Task 2/3: built or not, with real reasoning either way — a "didn't build, here's why" is exactly as valid a result as a new source, don't feel pressure to build both just because they were surfaced.


## Claude

Good — `matches`, `stage1_reject`, `compute_uid` all already imported. Now let's view the full `run_once` to find exact insertion points.

Now `core/filter.py`:

Now the `run_pipeline.py` wiring — state functions, `discover_interndock`, and hooking into `run_once` + `__main__`.

Now add the load/save functions and `discover_interndock` right after `save_excluded_uids`:

Now add the import and wire into `run_once`:

Now wire the `run_once` signature and call site:

Now wire the `__main__` block to construct `interndock_fetch_fn` the same way `fetch_page_fn` is built:

Now let's write proper tests for `discover_interndock` and the `run_once` integration.

Now let's append the new test section:

All 4 pass. Now run the full suite:

All green. Now let's evaluate the two candidate sources — ApplyGuy first.

Now `ingestion/sources.py`:

Good, confirmed `main`. Now add `fetch_applyguy`:

Now `core/filter.py`:

Now wire into `run_pipeline.py`'s `SOURCES`:

Now fix `_fake_http_get_only_interndock`:

Now fix `tests/test_schema_drift.py`:

Now let's update imports, add an `applyguy_raw` fixture, fix `test_check_all_passes_when_all_sources_are_healthy`, and add ApplyGuy-specific drift tests.

Now add ApplyGuy-specific drift tests at the end of the file:

Now let's run the suite to see where we stand:

Now let's add the filter/normalize tests in `tests/test_filter.py`, mirroring the vanshb03 section exactly:

Now insert the ApplyGuy section right after the zshah101 block and before the Greenhouse/Ashby section:

Now add the imports for `normalize_applyguy`:

401/401 green. Now let's do a live sanity check of `fetch_applyguy` end-to-end against the real feed:

All 401 tests green, live-verified (200 fetched, 137 real matches — notably high yield). Let's commit Task 2 before moving to dreamworkhq.

Now let's evaluate `dreamworkhq/Tech-Internships-2027` (Task 3).

401/401 green, everything committed. Here's the report:

## Task 1 — InternDock wired into `SOURCES`, real design decisions made
- **Identity**: `raw_id` = the posting's own real Apply URL (always present, unique, stable) — no content-hash fallback needed, unlike the removed zapplyjobs source. `cross_source_key`'s existing ATS-URL regexes already collapse InternDock copies against direct Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever dossiers — verified live, no changes needed.
- **Cadence/state**: not a fixed schedule — idempotent instead. `discover_interndock()` persists which guide URLs it's already Firecrawl-fetched (`state/interndock_seen_guides.json`); checking the free sitemap stays hourly, but the paid Firecrawl call only fires the rare time something's genuinely new (real drops are ~6 weeks apart).
- **Architecture**: doesn't fit the uniform `SOURCES` tuple (needs Firecrawl + persisted state, not just `http_get`) — it's a separate step in `run_once()`, inserted last for write-priority. **Not** wired into `recheck.py`'s `FEEDS` — re-verifying would mean re-Firecrawling every seen drop page, real cost for content largely redundant with what `FEEDS` already covers directly.
- **Volume, confirmed with real numbers**: simulated a realistic 650-posting spike through the actual budget mechanism — it drains gracefully (4 written, 646 deferred, nothing breaks). But a **real, unflagged finding**: 14 of the 15 real fixture titles classify into the "Other" bucket (budget 1/run) because `classify()` doesn't recognize generic "Software Engineering Intern" titles — a real drop would bottleneck hard there. Not fixed (pre-existing taxonomy issue, not InternDock's bug) — flagged for a separate decision.

## Task 2 — ApplyGuy: built
Real, own-sourced (not a re-scrape, unlike `SuryaHarikrishnan` which was checked and rejected the same day), 202 entries, updates ~every 15 min, reaches Workday/Workable/Paylocity ATSes this pipeline has zero other coverage for. Live-verified end-to-end: **137/200 matched** — notably higher yield than any other source, mostly from correctly treating ApplyGuy's own "Not specified" season placeholder as permissive-missing-data rather than a literal unmatched string. Flagging plainly: this will hit the same one-time-backlog decision the 2026-07-25 four-source rollout did. Not wired into `recheck.py` — no direct evidence on absence-based closure reliability either way, left open rather than guessed.

## Task 3 — dreamworkhq: evaluated, **not built**
Real, live, MIT-licensed, richer schema than most existing sources (salary, AI-role classification), updates daily. But it has a disqualifying structural gap: **every listing's only URL is dreamworkhq.com's own gated job page** — no real per-posting employer ATS link anywhere in the feed or the rendered page. The page's own copy ("Apply with a tailored resume and cover letter from Dreamwork") confirms applying is mediated entirely through their own account/AI-cover-letter service, not a direct link. `companyDomain` exists but guessing a URL from a bare domain is exactly the blind-guessing anti-pattern already rejected earlier this round (Two Sigma/Citadel). This breaks the "real, direct apply link" value every other source in this pipeline provides, with no reliable fix available to us — didn't build it.

  - Scope of this module: detect candidate drop pages and parse their postings
into plain dicts. Deliberately NOT wired into run_pipeline.py's SOURCES/FEEDS
yet — that needs its own design pass (a raw_id strategy for postings with no
first-party id at all, a "seen guide URLs" state file, and a cadence decision
the way recheck.py earned its own daily cron instead of running hourly) —
flagged as the explicit next step, not assumed here.
"""
  + Wired into run_pipeline.py (Task 1, 2026-08-24), NOT via the uniform SOURCES
tuple — every SOURCES fetcher is a stateless fetch_fn(http_get), but
InternDock genuinely needs three things none of the others do: a Firecrawl
call (not just http_get), and read+write access to persisted state (which
guide URLs have already been Firecrawl-fetched, so a confirmed drop or a
confirmed non-drop is each checked at most once, ever). run_pipeline.py's
discover_interndock() is the separate step that threads that state through;
see its docstring for why idempotent state-gating replaces picking an
arbitrary cadence outright. Not wired into recheck.py's FEEDS — verifying
liveness would mean re-Firecrawling every previously-seen drop page just to
diff its postings, real ongoing Firecrawl cost for content that's largely
redundant with sources recheck.py already covers directly (Greenhouse/Ashby/
Lever postings that happen to also appear in an InternDock drop keep getting
rechecked via whichever of those wrote the one surviving dossier) — same
"real cost, low signal" reasoning that already keeps Freehire out of FEEDS.

raw_id is the posting's own real Apply URL (not a content hash the way the
old, now-removed zapplyjobs source needed) — see normalize_interndock below.

Wire InternDock into SOURCES (Task 1) + add ApplyGuy as a source (Task 2)

Committed together — the two changes interleave in the same import blocks
and shared test dispatchers in run_pipeline.py/test_run_pipeline.py, and
splitting that cleanly costs more than it buys here. Each remains
independently describable below.

## Task 1: InternDock discovery, wired end-to-end

Real design decisions made, not assumed:
- **Identity**: raw_id is the posting's own real Apply URL (every entry
  carries one — the actual employer ATS link), not a content hash the way
  the removed zapplyjobs source once needed. cross_source_key already
  collapses these against direct Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever copies via its
  existing ATS-URL job-id regexes — verified live, no changes needed there.
- **Cadence/state**: not a fixed schedule. discover_interndock() persists
  which guide URLs have been Firecrawl-fetched (state/interndock_seen_guides.json)
  and only ever fetches a new one once — real drops are ~6 weeks apart, so
  checking the free sitemap.xml hourly costs nothing extra; the one paid
  Firecrawl call only fires the rare time something's actually new.
- **Doesn't fit the uniform SOURCES tuple** (needs Firecrawl + persisted
  state, not just http_get) — it's a separate step in run_once(), inserted
  last so cross-source-duplicate ties resolve in favor of direct per-company
  sources. Not wired into recheck.py's FEEDS: re-verifying would mean
  re-Firecrawling every seen drop page just to diff postings, real ongoing
  cost for content largely redundant with sources recheck.py already covers.
- **Volume**: live-simulated a realistic 650-posting spike through the real
  budget/debate mechanism — confirmed it drains gracefully (this_run=4,
  deferred=646, nothing crashes or silently drops). Real finding, not
  assumed: 14 of the 15 real titles in the live fixture classify into the
  "Other" bucket (budget 1/run) because classify() doesn't recognize generic
  "Software Engineering Intern" titles as Fullstack/AI-ML/CyS&Finance — a
  real InternDock drop would bottleneck hard through that one bucket. Not
  fixed here (pre-existing bucket taxonomy, not an InternDock bug), flagged
  for a separate decision.

## Task 2: ApplyGuy (github.com/ApplyGuy/2027-Internships)

Confirmed live 2026-08-24: 202 real entries, own-sourced (not a re-scrape —
unlike SuryaHarikrishnan/2027-internship-tracker, checked and rejected the
same day for being 100% SimplifyJobs+vanshb03 re-aggregation), updates every
~15 minutes, reaches Workday/Workable/Paylocity ATSes this pipeline has zero
other coverage for. Real category field ("Software Engineering"/"Product") —
"Software Engineering" is already a literal match in profile.yaml's
allowlist, checked like SimplifyJobs. ~39% of entries (78/202) carry the
literal season placeholder "Not specified" — mapped to empty terms at
normalize time so the permissive missing-data branch fires correctly, not
treated as a real (and un-matchable) season string. url is ApplyGuy's own
utm-tagged tracking redirect; listingUrl (100% populated) is the real
employer ATS link and is what gets stored.

Live-verified end-to-end: 200 fetched, 137 real matches — notably higher
yield than every other source, largely from the permissive Not-specified
handling. Flagging plainly: a first live run will hit the same kind of
one-time-backlog decision the original 2026-07-25 four-source rollout did.
Not wired into recheck.py's FEEDS — no direct evidence either way on
absence-from-feed reliability (unlike Freehire's confirmed-stale closed_at
or AIJobs' confirmed-accurate snapshot behavior), left as an open question
rather than guessed.

385 -> 401 tests.

its own fetcher — every existing Palantir dossier arrived secondhand via SimplifyJobs/vanshb03's scrape. Seeded LEVER_COMPANIES with Palantir plus three real Lever-hosted companies found by grepping real dossier URLs for the jobs.lever.co/<company> pattern and confirming each live against api.lever.co: belvederetrading (3 real US intern titles), hermeus (6, US aerospace/defense), xsolla (12, mostly international but two real US ones). "acds" was checked and rejected — its categories.commitment values are workforce-program names, not an employment type; a job-training nonprofit, not a tech employer. Mirrors fetch_greenhouse/fetch_ashby's per-company-token structure: skip a dead board, don't crash the run. Title-text intern triage (not categories.commitment) — confirmed live that field is spelled "Intern" at Hermeus but "Internship" at Xsolla, inconsistent across companies unlike Ashby's employmentType enum. No structured term field, so _matches_lever = _matches_free_text_source, same fallback as Greenhouse/Ashby. Wired into run_pipeline.py's SOURCES and recheck.py's FEEDS (Lever's public API only ever returns open postings, same absent-from-feed closure signal as Greenhouse/Ashby). schema_drift.py's per-company exclusion comment extended to name Lever. cross_source_key's existing lever.co job-id regex already collapses these against the same postings SimplifyJobs/vanshb03 already surface — verified live, no changes needed there. 379 -> 385 tests (Lever fixtures added; shared test fake_get dispatcher in test_run_pipeline.py updated for LEVER_JOBS_URL's bare-list response shape).

That's the real precondition for treating it as an ongoing source. Guide pages themselves are client-rendered (a bare SPA shell over plain HTTP), so real content needs the same Firecrawl JS-render already used for ATS posting pages — reused fetch_posting_markdown rather than duplicating it. The URL slug alone isn't a reliable classifier: confirmed live that "[REDACTED]" is drop-shaped by name but is actually a prose advice article with zero structured postings, while "[REDACTED]" is a real 257+-posting drop. So CANDIDATE_SLUG_RE is a loose cost-control pre-filter only; the real gate is structural (parse match count vs. MIN_POSTINGS_FOR_DROP), applied to the actually-fetched content. POSTING_LINE_RE is built from real, verbatim text (WebFetch, 2026-08-24) of the live August-2026 drop page's first 15 entries — not the "- [Title](URL) *Company, Location*" shape a prior session's summary had guessed. The real link text is always the literal word "Apply"; the posting title (which may itself carry an em-dash-separated requisition id) sits before it; InternDock's own "*Company, See posting*" placeholder for a missing location maps to no location data, same permissive-by-default convention as every other source's missing-location case. Scope: detection + parsing only, real-fixture tested (15/15 real entries parse correctly, including the requisition-id and Lever-URL cases). Deliberately NOT wired into SOURCES/FEEDS yet — that needs its own design pass (a raw_id strategy for postings with no first-party id, a seen-guide- URLs state file, a cadence decision), flagged as the next step rather than assumed here.

Each remains independently describable below. ## Task 1: InternDock discovery, wired end-to-end Real design decisions made, not assumed: - **Identity**: raw_id is the posting's own real Apply URL (every entry carries one — the actual employer ATS link), not a content hash the way the removed zapplyjobs source once needed. cross_source_key already collapses these against direct Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever copies via its existing ATS-URL job-id regexes — verified live, no changes needed there. - **Cadence/state**: not a fixed schedule. discover_interndock() persists which guide URLs have been Firecrawl-fetched (state/interndock_seen_guides.json) and only ever fetches a new one once — real drops are ~6 weeks apart, so checking the free sitemap.xml hourly costs nothing extra; the one paid Firecrawl call only fires the rare time something's actually new. - **Doesn't fit the uniform SOURCES tuple** (needs Firecrawl + persisted state, not just http_get) — it's a separate step in run_once(), inserted last so cross-source-duplicate ties resolve in favor of direct per-company sources. Not wired into recheck.py's FEEDS: re-verifying would mean re-Firecrawling every seen drop page just to diff postings, real ongoing cost for content largely redundant with sources recheck.py already covers. - **Volume**: live-simulated a realistic 650-posting spike through the real budget/debate mechanism — confirmed it drains gracefully (this_run=4, deferred=646, nothing crashes or silently drops). Real finding, not assumed: 14 of the 15 real titles in the live fixture classify into the "Other" bucket (budget 1/run) because classify() doesn't recognize generic "Software Engineering Intern" titles as Fullstack/AI-ML/CyS&Finance — a real InternDock drop would bottleneck hard through that one bucket. Not fixed here (pre-existing bucket taxonomy, not an InternDock bug), flagged for a separate decision. ## Task 2: ApplyGuy (github.com/ApplyGuy/2027-Internships) Confirmed live 2026-08-24: 202 real entries, own-sourced (not a re-scrape — unlike SuryaHarikrishnan/2027-internship-tracker, checked and rejected the same day for being 100% SimplifyJobs+vanshb03 re-aggregation), updates every ~15 minutes, reaches Workday/Workable/Paylocity ATSes this pipeline has zero other coverage for. Real category field ("Software Engineering"/"Product") — "Software Engineering" is already a literal match in profile.yaml's allowlist, checked like SimplifyJobs. ~39% of entries (78/202) carry the literal season placeholder "Not specified" — mapped to empty terms at normalize time so the permissive missing-data branch fires correctly, not treated as a real (and un-matchable) season string. url is ApplyGuy's own utm-tagged tracking redirect; listingUrl (100% populated) is the real employer ATS link and is what gets stored. Live-verified end-to-end: 200 fetched, 137 real matches — notably higher yield than every other source, largely from the permissive Not-specified handling. Flagging plainly: a first live run will hit the same kind of one-time-backlog decision the original 2026-07-25 four-source rollout did. Not wired into recheck.py's FEEDS — no direct evidence either way on absence-from-feed reliability (unlike Freehire's confirmed-stale closed_at or AIJobs' confirmed-accurate snapshot behavior), left as an open question rather than guessed. 385 -> 401 tests.
