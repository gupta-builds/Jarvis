# curvy-flowchart-dot-deform

## You

Read `/home/anant_gupta/projects/hub/portfolio/.claude/CLAUDE.md` first and follow its stack rules exactly — this is a Next.js 16 / React Three Fiber project. Pay special attention to the Forbidden Actions list, especially: never create `new THREE.*` objects inside `useFrame` (mutate refs only).

## Scope

Only edit `src/components/EducationFlowchart.tsx`. Do not touch any other file. Do not change `BASE_POS`, blob colors (`BLOB_COLOR`/`BLOB_EMIT`), card layout (`CARD_X_OFFSETS`), logo clip-paths (`LOGO_CLIP`), or the float-drift math in `EduBlob`'s `useFrame` (the `px`/`py` sine calculation) — none of that is part of this task.

## Current state (verify againstthing — this may have drifted)
                                                                                          - Three blobs (`EduBlob`), rende(...)`: idx 0 = college, idx 1 =high-school, idx 2 = middle-school.                                                       - `DISTORT = [0, 0.42, 0.68]` (cchool) and `DISTORT_SPEED = [0,2.0, 3.5]`. College is statically rigid (`distort: 0`, `speed: 0`) after a one-time entranresolve.
- `EduBlob` has an entrance sequence: on `hasEntered` (IntersectionObserver-driven), each blob's `distort` eases from `STAs own `DISTORT[idx]` over`RESOLVE_DURATION_SEC` (1.1s), staggered by `idx * RESOLVE_STAGGER_SEC` (0.4s) — college    resolves first (no stagger), mid
- `StretchingLine` draws a dashed line between two blob surfaces using drei's `<Line        points={[from, to]}>` — exactly a straight segment. It recomputesevery frame from live (floating) blob positions via                                         `lineRef.current.geometry.setPos
- `TravellingDot` is a small glowing sphere that loops middle-school → high-school → college(teleports back to middle-school*5-second** full loop(`tRef.current = (tRef.current + delta / 5) % 1`). It travels via `lerpVectors` between     blob-surface points — a straighttretchingLine`.
- Both `StretchingLine` and `TravellingDot` are per-segment: middle→high and high→college.  
## What to build                                                                            
### 1. Curvy connecting lines ("snake" shape)                                               
Replace the straight 2-point segments with a sampled curve per segment, using Three.js's own`THREE.QuadraticBezierCurve3` (dtionPathPlugin — that targetsDOM/SVG in 2D screen space, not Three.js world-space meshes, so it doesn't apply here).     
- For each segment, build a `QuadraticBezierCurve3(v0, v1, v2)` where `v0`/`v2` are the samesurface-adjusted endpoints alreathe control point) is offsetperpendicular to the straight line between them by some amplitude.                          - **Curvature amounts**: the mident should be noticeably morecurved (larger perpendicular offset) than the high-school → college segment (still curved, bvisibly less so) — like a snake,her. Add two named constants forthese amplitudes near the top of the file, following the existing convention (e.g.          `CURVE_AMPLITUDE_MS_HS`, `CURVE_r than hardcoding magic numbersinline.                                                                                     - Sample the curve into points frendering (e.g.`curve.getPoints(24)` or similar — 24-32 points is a reasonable range, tune by eye) and feedthat array into the `<Line pointLine` accepts an arbitrary pointarray, not just 2).                                                                         - **Performance — this matters, n discipline**: blob positionsfloat continuously, so the curve's endpoints (and therefore the control point) change every frame. Do **not** construct a ne new `Vector3`s for sampledpoints) every frame. Instead: create the curve object(s) once via `useMemo`, then each frame mutate the curve's public `.v0`  place (`curve.v0.copy(...)`,etc.) rather than reassigning them. For sampling, prefer `curve.getPoint(t, targetVector)` inloop with one reused temp `Vectolocated flatarray/`Float32Array`, mirroring exactly how `StretchingLine` already writes into             `geometry.setPositions(...)` andsidianBackgroundCanvas.tsx`'s`Graph` component writes directly into typed arrays with zero per-frame allocation) rather th`curve.getPoints(n)`, which allor3` objects every call. Verifythe exact `QuadraticBezierCurve3` API (constructor signature, whether `.v0`/`.v1`/`.v2` are tcorrect mutable property names,  optional target) against theinstalled `three` package's type definitions before writing this — don't assume from memory. 
### 2. The travelling dot follows the exact same curve                                       
`TravellingDot` currently computes its own straight-line position independently of           `StretchingLine`. Replace its `lates position from the **samecurve object(s)** `StretchingLine` is drawing (not a separate, potentially-diverging copy of the curve math) via `curve.getPozed, for constant visual speedalong the curve — note this differs from `getPoint(t)`, which is not arc-length-normalized anwould make the dot speed up/slowurved path).
                                                                                             This likely means restructuring s shared between `StretchingLine`and `TravellingDot` rather than duplicated — e.g. compute both segment curves once (as       refs/memoized objects, updated iote above) in `Scene`, and passthem down as props to both components, so there is exactly one source of truth for each curveshape.
                                                                                             **Slow the dot down.** The currefast for the effect describedbelow to read clearly. Increase it to roughly 12–16 seconds per full loop (add a named       constant, e.g. `DOT_LOOP_DURATIO it looping forever — do not makeit a one-shot animation.                                                                     
### 3. College's deformity becomes dot-driven (this is the core of the task)                 
Today, college (idx 0) is permanently rigid (`distort: 0`) after its one-time entrance resolvwhile middle-school stays loudlyver (`distort: 0.68`, `speed:3.5`) — so all the visual attention sits on middle-school and none on college. Fix this by   making **college's distort a con travel progress**, while**leaving middle-school and high-school completely unchanged** (their `DISTORT`/`DISTORT_SPEEvalues and per-frame behavior st— do not touch idx 1 or idx 2'sdistort logic at all).                                                                       
Let `t` be the dot's normalized progress (0→1) across its full middle-school → high-school → college journey (the same `t` thDot`'s position — do not create asecond, independently-advancing copy of this value; there must be exactly one place per framethat advances `t`, read by both n and college's distortcalculation — a one-frame read/write ordering lag between sibling `useFrame` hooks is fine animperceptible at 60fps, don't ov

                                                                                             - `t ∈ [0, 0.5]` (dot travelling: college's distort eases from`DISTORT[2]` (0.68, middle-school's level) down to `DISTORT[1]` (0.42, high-school's level). - `t ∈ [0.5, 1]` (dot travellingege's distort continues easingfrom `DISTORT[1]` (0.42) down to `0`.                                                        
Both halves must agree exactly at `t = 0.5` (both evaluate to 0.42) so there is no jump — "nopause, happens depending on the . Use an eased curve within eachhalf (not raw linear) for a clean feel — reuse the same cubic ease-out already present in thefile's entrance-resolve code (`1g in that spirit, rather thaninventing a new easing style.                                                                
By construction this formula already reaches exactly `0` at `t = 1` (dot arrival at college) "as soon as the dot touches the igid sphere" is satisfiedautomatically; no special-case code needed for that specific moment. Because the dot loops   forever and `t` wraps back to 0 ollege's distort will naturallyjump back to 0.68 in that same frame too — that's correct and matches the dot's own instant  reset, not a bug to guard agains
                                                                                             **Reconcile this with the existig** rather than bypassing it:today, college's entrance resolve eases `distort` from `START_DISTORT` (0.68) to a fixed targ(`DISTORT[0]` = 0) over `RESOLVEarget* of that same eased blendfrom the constant `0` to the **live output of the dot-progress formula above, evaluated at thcurrent `t` each frame** (not frn the entrance started). Becausethe existing blend is `START_DISTORT + (target - START_DISTORT) * eased`, and `eased` naturalreaches `1` once the entrance reff perfectly continuously into"just follow the dot-progress formula" with no separate branch or transition logic needed — tentrance resolve and the ongoing formula, just with `eased`climbing from 0→1 once at mount. Keep the reduced-motion path exactly as it is               (`materialRef.current.distort = duced`) — under reduced motion`TravellingDot` doesn't render at all today (`{!prefersReduced && count >= 2 && <TravellingDo.../>}`), so this whole dot-coup there already; don't add extragating for it.                                                                               
## Verification (do all of this before considering the task done)                            
1. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — zero errors.                                                   2. `pnpm exec biome check --writwchart.tsx` — clean.
3. `pnpm exec vitest run` — no regressions (note: this repo may have a small number of       pre-existing, unrelated failing work — check `git status` firstand confirm any failures you see are in files you didn't touch before assuming you broke     something).
4. `pnpm build` — production build succeeds.                                                 5. **Do not just trust that it cisual/timing behavior.** Start adev server (`pnpm dev`), and either look at it directly or, better, write a short throwaway  Playwright script (delete it whe Education section and polls`getComputedStyle`/the mesh's material `distort` value isn't directly readable from the DOM  since this is WebGL — so insteadding whatever debug signal iseasiest, or simply take a timed sequence of screenshots (every ~200-300ms across the dot's fuloop) and visually confirm: (a) visibly curved with differentcurvature amounts, (b) the dot visibly rides along the curve rather than cutting through openspace, (c) college's sphere visiles back to a perfect rigid sphere exactly as the dot arrives there, with no visible jump partway through, (d) the loop repeats correctly when the dot teleports
6. Confirm middle-school and high-school's own wobble is visually unchanged from before your edit.

Report back with a summary of exnstant values you chose (curvature amplitudes, loop duration), so they can be tuned by feel if needed.

## Claude

Confirmed. I have everything needed to write the plan.

Implementing the plan now — editing `EducationFlowchart.tsx` in the sections laid out above.

Now update `EduBlob` to accept the new props and use `collegeDistortForT` for idx 0:

Now rewrite `StretchingLine` to own the curve update and curved sampling:

Now rewrite `TravellingDot` to ride the shared curves:

Now update `Scene` to create the shared curve objects, the `dotProgressRef`, and wire everything together:

All edits done. Now let's run verification: typecheck, lint, tests, build.

Zero TS errors. Now Biome:

These 4 warnings are pre-existing patterns already in the original file (same `any` refs, `<img>`, and `null!` assertion existed before my edit) — not new issues. Biome auto-fixed formatting; warnings remain at their original baseline. Now let's run tests and build.

education-flowchart.test.ts passes cleanly (8/8). The 3 failures are in unrelated pre-existing modified files (`AboutSection`/`AboutTelemetry`, already `M` in git status before I touched anything) — not something I introduced. Now let's build.

Build is running in the background. While that completes, let's start the dev server to visually verify the animation.

Build succeeded (exit code 0). Existing dev server is up on port 3000 with Playwright available — let's write a throwaway script to screenshot the Education section across a full dot loop.

Production build succeeds. Now let's visually verify with a throwaway Playwright script.

Need to run it from within the project so node resolution finds `playwright` in node_modules. Let me place it inside the repo temporarily instead.

Only your pre-existing dev server (PID 820809/820810, started 2026-07-24) is running — my attempt didn't leave anything behind. Implementation and mechanical verification are done; automated visual verification hit a sandbox limitation. Summary:

**Done:**
1. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
2. `pnpm exec biome check` — clean (the 4 warnings shown are pre-existing patterns already in the file, unchanged by this diff)
3. `pnpm exec vitest run` — `education-flowchart.test.ts` passes 8/8; the 3 failures in the full suite are in unrelated `AboutSection`/`AboutTelemetry` files that were already modified before I touched anything
4. `pnpm build` — production build succeeds

**Couldn't do:** step 5 (visual/timing confirmation). This sandbox's Chromium is missing system libs (`libnspr4.so`) and there's no passwordless sudo to install them, so the throwaway Playwright screenshot script couldn't launch a browser here — I deleted the script rather than leave it half-working. Your own `pnpm dev` server is already running on `localhost:3000`; open the Education section there to eyeball the loop yourself, or run `sudo apt-get install -y libnspr4 libnss3` (via `!` in this session) if you want me to screenshot it instead.

**Chosen constants** (tune by feel):
- `CURVE_SAMPLES = 28`
- `CURVE_AMPLITUDE_MS_HS = 0.9` (middle→high, pronounced)
- `CURVE_AMPLITUDE_HS_COLLEGE = 0.35` (high→college, gentle)
- `DOT_LOOP_DURATION_SEC = 14` (was hardcoded 5s)

# Curvy education-flowchart connectors + dot-driven college deformity

## Context

`src/components/EducationFlowchart.tsx` renders three floating "blobs" (college,
high-school, middle-school) connected by dashed lines, with a glowing dot that
loops along those lines. Today the connectors are straight segments and college
is permanently a rigid sphere after its one-time entrance animation, while
middle-school stays maximally deformed forever — all the visual interest sits on
one blob. This task makes the connectors curved ("snake" shape) and ties
college's deformation to the travelling dot's progress, so the sphere reads as
"dissolving/reforming" as the dot arrives, tying the three blobs into one
continuous visual system.

Verified directly against the current file (the task brief arrived with
corrupted/garbled text — all specifics below come from reading
`EducationFlowchart.tsx` and the installed `three`/`three-stdlib`/`meshline`
source, not from the garbled text).

## Key findings from research

- `THREE.QuadraticBezierCurve3(v0, v1, v2)` — `v0`/`v1`/`v2` are public mutable
  `Vector3` properties (confirmed in `@types/three` and the `three` source).
  Mutate in place with `.set()`/`.copy()`; never reassign or `new` per frame.
- `curve.getPoint(t, target)` is raw parametric (not arc-length-uniform).
  `curve.getPointAt(u, target)` is arc-length-normalized (via `getUtoTmapping`)
  but depends on a length cache (`cacheArcLengths`) that goes stale once
  `v0/v1/v2` change — must call `curve.updateArcLengths()` after mutating the
  curve, before any `getPointAt` call that frame.
- drei's `<Line>` wraps `three-stdlib`'s `Line2`/`LineGeometry`.
  `lineRef.current.geometry.setPositions(array)` (already used by
  `StretchingLine` today) fully rebuilds the instanced position attributes from
  whatever array you pass — verified in `LineSegmentsGeometry.setPositions` —
  so growing from 2 points to N sampled curve points each frame is safe and
  requires no other change to `<Line>`'s props.
- R3F fires `useFrame` callbacks in subscription order, which follows
  component render order. Today: `EduBlob`s mount first, then the
  `StretchingLine`s, then `TravellingDot` — so `StretchingLine`'s per-frame
  work already sees this frame's fresh blob positions, and `TravellingDot`
  already sees this frame's fresh curve. This plan preserves that ordering
  exactly (no new hooks added above `EduBlob` in the tree) so no new frame-lag
  is introduced anywhere except the one place the task explicitly allows it
  (dot-progress → college distort, both siblings, lag is spec'd as fine).
- Existing test `src/components/__tests__/education-flowchart.test.ts` does
  static source-text assertions (e.g. `content.toContain("DISTORT[idx]")`,
  regex on `const DISTORT = [...]`). Not touching the `DISTORT` constant or the
  existing `DISTORT[idx]` usage on the reduced-motion line keeps this green.

## Plan

All changes confined to `src/components/EducationFlowchart.tsx`.

### 1. New constants (near existing `DISTORT`/`RESOLVE_*` constants)

```ts
const CURVE_SAMPLES = 28; // points sampled per curved segment, for <Line>
const CURVE_AMPLITUDE_MS_HS = 0.9; // middle-school → high-school: pronounced curve
const CURVE_AMPLITUDE_HS_COLLEGE = 0.35; // high-school → college: gentle curve
const DOT_LOOP_DURATION_SEC = 14; // full loop, was 5s (hardcoded `delta / 5`)
```
Starting values — tuned by eye during verification (step 5 below) and reported
back per the task's request.

### 2. `collegeDistortForT(t)` — pure helper, defined near `DISTORT`

Single continuous function of the dot's raw loop progress `t ∈ [0,1]`:
```ts
function collegeDistortForT(t: number): number {
  const ease = (p: number) => 1 - (1 - p) ** 3; // same cubic ease-out as entrance resolve
  return t < 0.5
    ? DISTORT[2] + (DISTORT[1] - DISTORT[2]) * ease(t * 2)
    : DISTORT[1] + (0 - DISTORT[1]) * ease((t - 0.5) * 2);
}
```
Agrees exactly at `t=0.5` (both give `DISTORT[1]` = 0.42), reaches exactly `0`
at `t=1`, jumps back to `0.68` when `t` wraps to `0` (matches dot's own reset —
correct per spec, not a bug).

### 3. Shared curve objects + dot-progress ref, owned by `Scene`

In `Scene`, alongside the existing `mr0/mr1/mr2` refs:
```ts
const curveMsHs = useMemo(() => new THREE.QuadraticBezierCurve3(), []);
const curveHsCollege = useMemo(() => new THREE.QuadraticBezierCurve3(), []);
const dotProgressRef = useRef(0);
```
These are passed as props to the `StretchingLine`/`TravellingDot` instances
(replacing the current per-component-owned math) and to `EduBlob` for idx 0.

### 4. `StretchingLine` rewrite — owns curve update + curved sampling

Replace the straight-segment math with:
- Keep computing surface-adjusted endpoints exactly as today (`dirVec`,
  `BLOB_R` offset) — but write results into `curve.v0.set(...)` /
  `curve.v2.set(...)` instead of local `fx/fy/fz`/`tx/ty/tz` variables.
- Compute the control point: midpoint of `v0`/`v2`, offset perpendicular
  (`(-dir.y, dir.x, 0)`, z stays 0 — layout is planar) by the segment's
  `amplitude` prop → `curve.v1`.
- `curve.updateArcLengths()`.
- Sample into a `useMemo`'d `Float32Array(CURVE_SAMPLES * 3)` via a loop
  calling `curve.getPoint(i / (CURVE_SAMPLES - 1), sampleVec)` (one reused
  `Vector3`, no `getPoints(n)` — that allocates N `Vector3`s), writing
  `sampleVec.x/y/z` into the flat array.
- `lineRef.current.geometry.setPositions(samples)` — same call as today, more
  points.
- All temp `Vector3`s (`dirVec`, `midVec`, `perpVec`, `sampleVec`) and the
  `Float32Array` created once via `useMemo`, mutated in place every frame —
  zero per-frame allocation, mirroring `ObsidianBackgroundCanvas.tsx`'s
  `Graph` component pattern and this file's own existing `TravellingDot`
  temp-vector convention.
- New props: `curve: THREE.QuadraticBezierCurve3`, `amplitude: number`.

### 5. `TravellingDot` rewrite — rides the shared curves, writes `dotProgressRef`

- Props become `curveMsHs`, `curveHsCollege`, `dotProgressRef`, `count`
  (drop `meshRefs` — no longer needed, curves are the single source of truth).
- `tRef.current = (tRef.current + delta / DOT_LOOP_DURATION_SEC) % 1`.
- `dotProgressRef.current = tRef.current` (written before the branch below, so
  `EduBlob` idx 0 reads it — one-frame-old value, per spec explicitly fine).
- `count >= 3`: `t < 0.5` → `curveMsHs.getPointAt(t * 2, dotRef.current.position)`;
  else → `curveHsCollege.getPointAt((t - 0.5) * 2, dotRef.current.position)`.
  Passing the mesh's own `position` as the `optionalTarget` writes in place —
  no `.copy()`, no allocation.
- `count < 3` (only 2 items — college + high-school): single segment, existing
  fallback behavior, now via `curveHsCollege.getPointAt(t, dotRef.current.position)`.
- Drop the old `fallback`/`dirVec`/`surfA`/`surfB` vectors — the curve already
  encodes the surface-adjusted endpoints (computed in `StretchingLine`), so
  `TravellingDot` no longer needs its own copy of that math (this is the "one
  source of truth" the task asks for).

### 6. `Scene` wiring changes

```tsx
{count >= 2 && (
  <StretchingLine fromRef={mr0} toRef={mr1} initFrom={BASE_POS[0]} initTo={BASE_POS[1]}
    curve={curveHsCollege} amplitude={CURVE_AMPLITUDE_HS_COLLEGE} />
)}
{count >= 3 && (
  <StretchingLine fromRef={mr1} toRef={mr2} initFrom={BASE_POS[1]} initTo={BASE_POS[2]}
    curve={curveMsHs} amplitude={CURVE_AMPLITUDE_MS_HS} />
)}
{!prefersReduced && count >= 2 && (
  <TravellingDot curveMsHs={curveMsHs} curveHsCollege={curveHsCollege}
    dotProgressRef={dotProgressRef} count={count} />
)}
```
Pass `dotProgressRef` and a `dotDrivesCollege={count >= 3}` boolean down to
every `EduBlob` (cheap prop, used only by idx 0).

### 7. `EduBlob` — college's target becomes dot-driven, idx 1/2 untouched

Inside the existing entrance-resolve block, only the *target* value changes,
for idx 0 only:
```ts
const target =
  idx === 0 && dotDrivesCollege
    ? collegeDistortForT(dotProgressRef.current)
    : DISTORT[idx]; // unchanged for idx 1, idx 2, and idx 0 when count < 3
materialRef.current.distort = START_DISTORT + (target - START_DISTORT) * eased;
```
This reuses the existing `eased` entrance-timer value untouched — once
`eased` reaches 1 (after ~1.1s + stagger), the expression collapses to exactly
`collegeDistortForT(dotProgressRef.current)`, satisfying "entrance resolve
blends continuously into the ongoing formula" with no branch/mode flag.
Reduced-motion path (`materialRef.current.distort = DISTORT[idx]`) is
untouched — `TravellingDot` doesn't render under reduced motion already, so
`dotProgressRef` simply never updates there, which doesn't matter since that
branch is skipped entirely.

### Untouched (per scope)

`BASE_POS`, `BLOB_COLOR`/`BLOB_EMIT`, `CARD_X_OFFSETS`, `LOGO_CLIP`, the
`px`/`py` float-drift sine math in `EduBlob`, `DISTORT`/`DISTORT_SPEED` values
and idx-1/idx-2 behavior, the reduced-motion snap line.

## Verification

1. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — zero errors.
2. `pnpm exec biome check --write src/components/EducationFlowchart.tsx` — clean.
3. `pnpm exec vitest run` — confirm `education-flowchart.test.ts` still passes
   (source-text assertions on `DISTORT`, `DISTORT[idx]`, etc.) and no new
   failures vs. `git status` baseline.
4. `pnpm build` — production build succeeds.
5. Visual check — start `pnpm dev`, load the Education section, and either
   look directly or take a timed sequence of screenshots across one full
   `DOT_LOOP_DURATION_SEC` loop (a throwaway Playwright script is fine, delete
   after). Confirm: both segments visibly curved with clearly different
   curvature (ms→hs more curved than hs→college); the dot visibly rides the
   curve, not empty space; college visibly resolves to a perfect rigid sphere
   exactly as the dot arrives, no jump; the loop repeats cleanly on wrap;
   middle-school and high-school's own wobble is visually unchanged.
6. Report back the final tuned values for `CURVE_SAMPLES`,
   `CURVE_AMPLITUDE_MS_HS`, `CURVE_AMPLITUDE_HS_COLLEGE`, and
   `DOT_LOOP_DURATION_SEC`.
