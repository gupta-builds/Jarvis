# Deep adx review phase 1: read and understand

## You

# Session Goal: Deep adx Review — Phase 1 Only (Read, Understand, Then Stop)

## The Full Arc (context only — most of this is NOT what you do right now)
This is the next stage of an ongoing mentorship deliverable: a rigorous, non-amateur
review of Ahnaf's adx project, ending in real GitHub issues and a polished
source-of-truth document. The full plan has 5 stages:

1. Review every existing note on adx (already written) plus the mentor-meeting notes.
2. Get a genuinely deeper understanding of adx by reading the actual cloned codebase
   directly — not just the prior notes about it.
3. (LATER, NOT NOW) Challenge and rewrite the existing "Recommended Fixes" note based
   on what's actually found in the code, then open real GitHub issues on
   ahnafyy/adx — each backed by specific evidence, interlinked, explaining exactly
   why and what needs to change. Not amateur suggestions.
4. (LATER, NOT NOW) Write a single, polished Word document explaining every issue
   opened, why, the recommended fix, and forward-looking ideas informed by
   competitors (e.g. Factory AI's "Agent Readiness" concept, and others still to be
   researched) — this becomes the source of truth, built entirely from what's
   captured in Jarvis.
5. YOUR ACTUAL JOB IN THIS SESSION IS ONLY STEPS 1 AND 2. Do not create the Word
   document. Do not open GitHub issues. Do not propose fixes yet. Stop once the
   review is genuinely complete, and ask clarifying questions before anything gets
   written down.

## Step 1 — Read every existing note first
Four notes already exist, each with a specific, deliberate role. Read all four in
full before touching any code:

- D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\20_Progress\Mentorship Program\adx\Source Claims.md
  — what adx's own docs/README claim, captured faithfully, no judgment mixed in
- D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\20_Progress\Mentorship Program\adx\Claims vs Implementation.md
  — every one of those claims checked directly against the code as it stood on
  2026-07-22, file and line
- D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\20_Progress\Mentorship Program\adx\Recommended Fixes.md
  — the actionable punch list from that review. This is exactly what step 3 will
  later challenge and improve — read it critically, not as gospel.
- D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\20_Progress\Mentorship Program\adx\adx.md
  — the MOC: what adx is, how to use it, competitive landscape, open questions

Then the mentorship context — four more files:

- D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\20_Progress\Mentorship Program\Meetings\Mentor Meeting Transcript.md
  — the raw 2026-07-14 call. adx is the thing Ahnaf explicitly asked for feedback
  on; a memory/graph-layer idea for evidence bundles was floated and well received.
  Speaker labels in this transcript are unreliable — read for substance.
- D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\20_Progress\Mentorship Program\Meetings\Project Briefings - 2026-07-13.md
  — the actual substantive debrief of that call. Prefer this over the raw transcript
  for signal.
- D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\20_Progress\Mentorship Program\Meetings\Mentor Meeting Playbook.md
- D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\20_Progress\Mentorship Program\Meetings\Mentor Meeting - One-Pager.md

A Codebase subfolder already exists at ...\adx\Codebase\ — empty, waiting for what
you write once this whole review is done and I've answered your questions. Do not
write into it yet.

One known issue, not yours to fix: the wikilinks between the four adx notes may not
currently resolve (they reference an older filename convention). Don't be thrown by
a broken [[link]] inside one of them — go by the real paths listed above.

## Step 2 — Read the actual cloned codebase in full depth
Location: /home/anant_gupta/projects/ai/claude/second-brain-claudekit/sandbox/adx

First: cd there, run `git log --oneline` and `git status`. The prior code review
(2026-07-22, captured in Claims vs Implementation.md) was done against a repo with
exactly ONE commit. If there's more history now, or unfamiliar uncommitted state,
say so explicitly before treating anything in that note as still accurate.

The prior review already went deep on: adx-core/{metrics,agency,config,ratchet,
harness}.ts; adx-gate/{taste,mutation,gate,abstraction,intent,evidence,ui}.ts;
adx-shape/{tokens,cycles,scanner}.ts; adx-sweep/{exports,fixer}.ts; adx-maintain/
{hook,frozen}.ts; adx-mcp/index.ts; adx-cli/index.ts and commands/{audit,
audit-vitals,sweep}.ts; adx-vscode/extension.ts. Verify each finding in Claims vs
Implementation still holds against current code — don't assume it's unchanged.

More importantly, these were NOT read in the prior pass — this is where "deeper
understanding" actually means something, and where you should spend real effort:

- The test files themselves, not just counts: adx-core/src/{harness,index}.test.ts,
  adx-gate/src/index.test.ts, adx-maintain/src/index.test.ts,
  adx-shape/src/index.test.ts, adx-sweep/src/{fixer,index}.test.ts. What do they
  actually assert? What's covered vs missing? Real test content shows what the
  author considers "correct," which can differ from what the docs claim.
- adx-cli/src/commands/{init,init-agents,init-generators,init-mcp,maintain,run,
  gate}.ts and onboarding.ts — the CLI command wrappers, none read before.
- adx-core/src/{context,harness-utils,hooks,index,plan,state,worktree}.ts — the
  harness's supporting modules; only harness.ts itself got close attention.
- adx-shape/src/{index,imports}.ts; adx-sweep/src/{index,dark-patterns,sweep}.ts;
  adx-maintain/src/index.ts; adx-gate/src/index.ts — package entry points, mostly
  unread.
- adx-vscode/src/{panel,types}.ts — the webview dashboard's actual content was
  never inspected.
- Every package's own package.json and tsconfig.json — dependency versions, peer
  deps, build targets.
- Any CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, or CODEOWNERS — check if they even
  exist; their presence or absence is itself worth noting.
- Existing GitHub issues and PRs on the real repo:
  `gh issue list --repo ahnafyy/adx --state all` and
  `gh pr list --repo ahnafyy/adx --state all`. This matters directly for step 3
  later — don't let a future issue duplicate something already open, already
  closed as wontfix, or already in flight on a branch.

Cross-reference everything against the live docs as you go — you must stay aware
of these throughout: https://github.com/ahnafyy/adx,
https://ahnafyy.github.io/adx/, and https://ahnafyy.github.io/adx/getting-started/
— in case anything has changed there since 2026-07-22.

## How to work through this
Don't try to hold the whole codebase in your head in one pass. Work in small
chunks — read a package or a cluster of related files, form a real conclusion
about it, then move to the next. Note anything genuinely surprising or
load-bearing as you go so it doesn't get lost by the time you finish the rest.
This has real breadth — 8 packages, config, tests, CLI wiring, and now issue
history — pacing it deliberately matters more than speed.

## Load these before you're done (not needed today, needed for later steps)
D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\HUMAN_WRITING.md,
D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\.claude\rules\human-writing.md, and
D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\30_Order\Standards\Source Summary Standard.md.
You don't need to write against them yet, but you should understand the voice and
structural bar this vault holds every note to — whatever eventually goes into
Codebase\ will be held to the same standard as the four notes you just read.

## When you're done
Stop. Do not write anything into Codebase\. Do not draft fixes. Do not touch
GitHub beyond the read-only `gh issue list`/`gh pr list` above. Summarize, in your
own words, what you now understand about adx that the existing four notes didn't
already tell you — the actual new signal from this pass, not a repeat of what
Claims vs Implementation already said. Then ask whatever questions you genuinely
need answered before you'd be comfortable writing the next set of notes — about
scope, depth, how Codebase\ should be organized, anything real. Wait for real
answers before doing anything else.

Let me know if you want the broken wikilinks fixed now, or held for later.

## Claude

I'll start by loading the MCP filesystem/vault tools I need to read the four adx notes and mentorship context, while also checking the local sandbox repo state in parallel.

Important finding right away: the repo now has **17 commits**, not the single commit the 2026-07-22 review was based on. There's real history now — feature work through Options B/C/D/E (harness, publish, sweep fixers, MCP+editors) plus CI fixes and a landing-page overhaul. Nothing in Claims vs Implementation can be assumed current. Let me read the vault notes now.

The `jarvis-fs` server is sandboxed to this repo only — it can't reach the Windows vault paths. Let me try the vault-specific `jarvis` MCP server instead, which uses vault-relative paths.

Got it — vault-relative paths work. Reading the remaining three adx notes and the four mentorship-meeting notes now.

All four adx notes are read. Now pulling the four mentorship-context files.

Both note sets are fully read. Now let me set up tracking for the codebase pass and check for auxiliary files (docs, CONTRIBUTING, adx-intellij which wasn't in the prior review's package list).

This looks like a significant gap: `teardownWorktree` runs unconditionally in the `finally` block for every outcome, including `completed`, and `RunResult` never returns the worktree path. Let me check whether `adx run --exec` merges the worktree's changes back before that teardown fires — otherwise a successful agent run's work would be deleted.

Now the init/maintain command wrappers, which weren't in the prior review at all.

Review complete. Stopping here per the instructions — nothing written to `Codebase\`, no fixes drafted, no GitHub writes. Here's what's genuinely new from this pass, beyond what the four existing notes already told you.

## Repo state has moved on, but not where it matters

The repo is now at 17 commits (was 1 at the 2026-07-22 review) — real feature work: the harness runtime, npm-publish readiness, `sweep --fix/--auto`, MCP+VS Code+Cursor+Claude Code+IntelliJ integration, CI fixes, and a docs landing-page overhaul. **Zero of the fixes from `Recommended Fixes` were acted on.** I re-checked every "Integrity Fix" and "Documentation Fix" item line-by-line against current code: `signedBy: 'engineer'` hardcoded, CI auto-approves Level 6, the two false headline claims (import cycles "always score 0", gate score "below 60 blocks merge") are still stated verbatim in the docs — including in files touched by the docs-overhaul commit itself. `gh issue list`/`gh pr list --state all` on `ahnafyy/adx` both return empty — no open or closed issues or PRs exist yet, so nothing here would duplicate anything already tracked.

## New findings the prior pass didn't surface (it hadn't read these files)

**A worktree isolation gap that undercuts the core safety claim.** `harness.ts`'s `finally` block calls `teardownWorktree` unconditionally — for `completed`, `halted`, `slipped`, every outcome — and `RunResult` never returns the worktree path. Separately, `adx run --exec`'s shell-out adapter (`run.ts`) calls `execSync(exec, {...})` with **no `cwd` option**, so the agent process actually runs wherever the `adx` binary was invoked from, not inside the provisioned worktree at all. The "isolated git worktree" the docs and README lean on as the safety mechanism is provisioned and then discarded around an adapter that never used it. Zero test coverage exercises `--exec` mode or worktree provisioning — only `plan` mode is tested.

**`adx maintain override` doesn't exist anywhere.** The generated pre-commit hook (`hook.ts`) literally prints `adx maintain override --path "$FILE" --reason "<your reason>"` as the unblock instruction when it fires, and the docs describe the same command — but the CLI's `maintain` subcommands are only `install`/`uninstall`/`status`/`sync`. Anyone who actually gets frozen-path-blocked and follows the tool's own printed instructions hits an unknown-command error. This is a dead end for a real user, not just a docs gap.

**`.tsx` import resolution is broken.** `adx-shape/src/imports.ts`'s `resolveImport` unconditionally appends `.ts` after stripping `.js`, so any `./Foo` import resolving to an actual `Foo.tsx` file never matches in the file map — the edge is silently dropped. FRR/cycle detection on any React/JSX codebase systematically undercounts fan-in, fan-out, and cycles. Untested (no `.tsx` fixture anywhere in `adx-shape`'s test suite).

**`adx sweep`'s own dark-code categorization has a bug matching what it detects.** The logic-vs-type orphan split in `sweep.ts` — `!['interface','type','enum'].some(kw => e.symbol.match(/^[A-Z]/))` — never actually uses `kw`; it's an accidental no-op that degenerates to "does the symbol start with a capital letter," because `ExportRecord` never carried the real AST node kind through from `extractExports` in the first place. Untested.

**The VS Code webview builds HTML by raw string interpolation.** `panel.ts`'s `buildPanelHtml` inserts file paths, symbol names, and dark-comment *text* (free-form content after `TODO:`) directly into the HTML string with no escaping. `enableScripts: false` blocks live `<script>` execution but not HTML/CSS injection from a comment or identifier containing markup.

**adx-intellij is undocumented, unbuilt, and actually broken as shipped.** Not in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, not in the README's package table, not mentioned in any doc — genuinely new territory. `plugin.xml` declares two Tools-menu actions (`RunAuditAction`, `RunSweepAction`) whose classes don't exist anywhere in the source tree (`find -iname "*action*"` returns nothing) — IntelliJ would fail to load or register them. Separately, `AdxService.kt`'s `getFileTds` regex looks for a JSON key `"tdsScore"` that doesn't exist in the real CLI output shape (`tds.score`, nested) — it would never match and always returns null.

**No `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG`, or `CODEOWNERS` anywhere in the repo** — confirmed absent, not just unmentioned.

**The docs site now states two of the previously "silently no-op" config flags more confidently and more falsely** than before: `reference/config.md` now explicitly claims `requireExplanationInvariants` — "the gate checks diff content to detect these" — and `enforceTasteCheck` — "whether to run the taste deficit analysis... as part of `adx gate`" — both of which the code still contradicts directly (blanket non-empty-list check; unconditional execution regardless of the flag). These are sharper, more specific false claims than what `Claims vs Implementation` originally flagged.

## Questions before I'd write anything into `Codebase\`

Good, clear direction. First — quick correction: when I read all four adx notes and all four meeting notes, every one came back with `"unresolvedLinks": []` from the vault API. The wikilinks already resolve; there's nothing to fix there. I'll skip that step rather than "fix" something that isn't broken.

Now let's build the adx CLI and set up the throwaway test repo to empirically verify the `--exec` worktree bug.

Build succeeded cleanly. Now setting up the throwaway test repo as a sibling directory (not inside `claude-ai/`, not inside this repo).

A real crash on the very first command I ran — `adx init` throws `generateCopilotInstructions is not defined` and dies before printing the post-init banner. Let me check the source and what state was left behind.

Found something more severe than what I was testing for: **`adx init` crashes on every single fresh run** — a genuine `ReferenceError: generateCopilotInstructions is not defined`, confirmed by both the crash output and a repo-wide grep showing the function is called once and never defined or imported anywhere. This isn't a subtle edge case; it's the tool's primary onboarding command, and it fails 100% of the time, unconditionally, on every fresh project. `adx.config.ts` and `.adx/state/` were written before the crash, so I can still test `adx run --exec` against this half-initialized repo. Let's do that now.

This is very promising — the `feat: complete adx setup` commit explicitly describes splitting `init.ts` into `init-agents/generators/mcp.ts` "to remove orphaned exports." Let me check whether that's exactly where the `generateCopilotInstructions` bug was introduced.

Important correction needed — let me verify commit dates precisely, because this changes the whole framing.

Found something that overturns part of what I told you earlier — I need to correct the record.

## Correction: this isn't "16 commits of unaddressed feedback since the review"

I checked commit dates precisely and ran `git fetch origin` against the real `ahnafyy/adx` repo. **All 17 commits span exactly 3 hours 9 minutes** — 2026-07-06 23:34 to 2026-07-07 02:43 — one overnight solo sprint. `origin/master` matches local HEAD exactly; **there is nothing on the real GitHub repo newer than 2026-07-07**. The `Claims vs Implementation` note (written 2026-07-22) describes "exactly one commit" — that doesn't match what's actually in the history now, and I can't tell from here whether that was a reading error at the time or the history was rewritten later; either way, it's worth flagging as a discrepancy rather than something I can resolve. What I *can* confirm: the code `Claims vs Implementation` reviewed and the code I read today are the same final state, and **Ahnaf hasn't touched this repo in exactly a month.** My earlier line about "16 commits of real feature work since the review" was wrong — there was no "since." Correcting that now rather than letting it stand.

## What the empirical testing found (all reproduced live, not just read)

Built the CLI from source and ran it for real against a throwaway repo at `~/projects/ai/claude/adx-worktree-throwaway-test/`:

1. **`adx init` crashes on every fresh run, 100% of the time** — `ReferenceError: generateCopilotInstructions is not defined`. Traced it via `git show` to the exact origin: commit `d5d2610` split the fat `init.ts` into `init-agents.ts`/`init-generators.ts`/`init-mcp.ts` (explicitly to fix a file `adx`'s own tooling would flag as bloated) — and the function definition was dropped in the split while its call site survived in `init-mcp.ts`. It's been broken across all 5 subsequent commits, including the docs overhaul, because nothing tests `init` end-to-end. This is the single most severe finding of the whole review: the tool's own onboarding command has never worked since that refactor.
2. **`--exec` never runs inside the isolated worktree** — confirmed with a probe script: `pwd` inside the "agent" process printed the main repo root, not `.adx/worktrees/session-*`. Matches the static read (`execSync` with no `cwd` option).
3. **Verification hooks always run `tsc --noEmit`, unconditionally** — my throwaway repo has no `tsconfig.json` at all, and the run failed verification on a TypeScript-tool error regardless.
4. **`adx maintain override` genuinely doesn't exist** — confirmed via direct invocation, `ERROR Unknown command override`.
5. **`adx gate --ci` really does auto-approve with zero human input** — live run produced `"level": 6, "signedBy": "engineer"` in the agency ledger, matching the exact pattern found in adx's own dogfooded history.

The throwaway repo is still sitting at that path if you want me to keep testing against it, or I can delete it.

## Summary of everything this pass turned up

**Corrected timeline (important):** all 17 commits span one 3-hour window, 2026-07-06 23:34 to 2026-07-07 02:43. `git fetch origin` confirms nothing on the real repo since. This is a single overnight solo sprint, not ongoing development — my earlier "16 commits since the review" framing was wrong and I've corrected it above.

**Two bugs now traced to their exact origin, with different life stories:**
- `adx run --exec` never using the worktree (no `cwd` passed to `execSync`) has been broken since the very first commit that introduced `run.ts` (`d1edd4e`, hour 1 of the sprint) — it has *never* worked, in the tool's entire history.
- `adx init`'s crash (`generateCopilotInstructions is not defined`) was introduced later, at `d5d2610` — the function worked correctly for 2 commits, then got dropped when `init.ts` was split into three files specifically to fix a "fat file" adx's own tooling would flag. A refactor meant to fix agent-generated bloat introduced a runtime crash that's shipped, untested, ever since.

**One new finding from the diffs themselves, not visible from final-state code alone:** the commit `279d174` — self-titled "BER 50→100 (ADX 67→82)" — shows exactly how that jump happened: partly by adding a real CI workflow (legitimate), and partly by simultaneously loosening the BER detection logic in the same commit (matching `'adx audit'`/`'adx-cli'` in addition to `'adx gate'`, and accepting "a CI workflow exists" as equivalent to "a discernment matrix has actually run," justified in-code as "the gate will generate evidence on the next CI run"). Worth being precise with Ahnaf about this one — it's a real design tradeoff with a stated rationale, not silent gaming, but it is the exact mechanism behind a self-reported score improvement.

**adx-intellij's action classes were never committed, ever** — confirmed via `git log --all --diff-filter=A` across full history, not just absent from current HEAD. Born broken in the commit that introduced the plugin scaffold.

**The MCP's "duplicate" BER calc was deliberately minimal from day one** (comment: `// Minimal BER`), not an accidental drift from the CLI's version — worth stating that way rather than as divergence.

I've covered the 6 substantive feature commits plus the two decisive discoveries above; the remaining 11 commits are single-purpose chores (badge/branch-name/CI-cache/one docs-content commit) already fully captured by the stat overview and, for the docs one, by the direct content read earlier. I think the research phase is now genuinely deep — static reading of every package, live execution of the five highest-stakes claims, and commit-level archaeology on the ones that mattered. I'd suggest this is enough to start drafting the Codebase\ MOC + thematic notes you described, but that's your call — let me know if you want more digging first or if I should move to drafting.

# adx — Agentic Developer Experience

![ADX Score](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahnafyy/adx/master/.adx/badge.json)

**Adx** is an open-source framework for optimizing, running, and governing codebases consumed by autonomous AI coding agents.

It unifies **measurement** (Lighthouse-style vitals for machine readability) with **infrastructure** (runtime harness and strict verification gates) to protect your codebase from comprehension debt and abstraction bloat.

---

## The Three Pillars

Instead of letting agents run wild in your repository, adx structures the relationship between human engineers and machine capabilities across three operational phases:

```
  1. MEASURE               2. ORCHESTRATE           3. GOVERN
  (The Vitals)             (The Harness)            (The Gate)

┌───────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────┐  ┌───────────────────┐
│  Token Density    │ ──→│  Ephemeral Worktrees│─→│  Abstraction Diff │
│  File Revisit     │    │  Context Backlog    │  │  Mutation Testing │
│  Code Litter      │    │  Frozen Path Locks  │  │  Intent Mapping   │
└───────────────────┘    └─────────────────────┘  └───────────────────┘
  adx audit/shape/sweep    adx init/run/maintain    adx gate
```

---

## 1. Measure — The ADX Vitals

Traditional DX optimizes for human eyes. Agentic DX optimizes for token economy and context stability. `adx` measures your codebase against four machine-centric metrics:

| Vital | What it measures | Weight | Target |
|-------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| **TDS** — Token Density Score | Signal-to-noise ratio per file. Boilerplate, unused abstractions, and verbose wrappers burn agent context windows and raise costs. | 30%!|(MISSING) >85 |
| **FRR** — File Revisit Ratio | How often an agent re-reads the same files due to tight coupling or import cycles. High FRR = architectural smell. | 25%!|(MISSING) 0 cycles |
| **BER** — Boundary Evidence Rating | Whether CI enforces an immutable evidence bundle before agent-generated code can merge. No gate = no accountability. | 30%!|(MISSING) 100%!|(MISSING)
| **HDI** — Human Discernment Index | How far up the Agency Ladder your engineers operate across recent commits. Level ≤2 is rubber-stamping. Target Level 6+. | 15%!|(MISSING) Level 6+ |

### Measure Commands

**`adx audit`** — Evaluates the entire repository and prints the four-vitals scorecard. Use `--badge` to write `.adx/badge.json` for CI badges. Use `--ci` to fail the build below `minimumAdxScore`.

**`adx shape`** — Scans source files and reports per-file Token Density Scores and File Revisit Ratio. Shows the worst-scoring files so you know which ones to split or simplify.

**`adx sweep`** — Scans for agent-generated litter: orphaned exports (exported but never imported), dark comments (`TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK`), and fat files larger than the project median.

---

## 2. Orchestrate — The Agentic Harness

> "The agent is the system around the model. The scaffolding turns a model into a reliable engineering collaborator."

When an agent executes code, adx provisions a strict, isolated runtime context — **the Harness** — that prevents models from breaking your local environment or spiraling into token-wasting loops.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    AGENT INNER LOOP                     │
│                                                         │
│  Context ──→ Model Call ──→ Chain-of-Thought            │
│      ↑              │              │                    │
│      │         Verification    Progress.json            │
│      │           Hooks              │                   │
│      │         (test runner)        ↓                   │
│  Backlog ←──      Ratchet ←──    Failure                │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┘
                      │ isDone signal + verification pass
                      ↓
              ┌───────────────┐
              │ EVIDENCE GATE │  ← adx gate
              └───────┬───────┘
                      │
                      ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  ENGINEER OUTER LOOP                    │
│                                                         │
│  Discernment Matrix ──→ Sign-off ──→ Agency Ledger      │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The inner loop runs autonomously. The outer loop is the human accountability layer. The Evidence Gate is the hard boundary between them.

### Orchestrate Commands

**`adx init`** — Scaffolds the harness in your project:
- `adx.config.ts` — typed `createAgenticSystem()` configuration
- `AGENTS.md` — conventions injected into every agent session
- `llms.txt` — machine-readable structural map of the repository
- `.adx/state/` — `progress.json` + `adx-agency.json` ledger
- Agent specs for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor (6 focused agents each)
- MCP server registration for `.vscode/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`

**`adx run "<task>"`** — Assembles harness context and runs an agent:
- `--plan` — writes a prepared task file to `.adx/tasks/` for manual handoff
- `--exec <cmd>` — shells out to a CLI agent (e.g., `--exec claude`) with full context, isolated in a git worktree

**`adx maintain`** — Manages frozen path locks:
- `install` — installs the git pre-commit hook that blocks agents from touching sensitive paths
- `sync` — syncs `frozenIntents` from `adx.config.ts` to `.adx/frozen-paths.json`
- `status` — shows which paths are frozen

---

## 3. Govern — The Loop Boundary Gate

> "The ultimate breakdown in agentic workflows is comprehension debt — machines shipping code faster than humans can verify it."

`adx gate` is a programmatic gatekeeper between the Agent Inner Loop and the Engineer Outer Loop. It runs a 3-layer validation check on every diff:

1. **Abstraction Gate** — rejects the diff if the agent introduced excessive structural wrappers relative to functional logic (default threshold: 8%!o(MISSING)verhead)
2. **Mutation Testing** — injects controlled bugs into the agent's new code; if tests still pass, it flags the suite as a tautological compliance facade
3. **Intent Cross-Reference** — compares the agent's chain-of-thought (`progress.json`) against actual file changes; flags semantic drift

After passing all three layers, `adx gate` presents the **Discernment Matrix** — an interactive terminal UI that forces the engineer to sign off at the appropriate level on the Agency Ladder before unlocking the merge. The signed evidence bundle is written to `.evidence/`.

**`adx gate`** — Runs locally or in CI. Use `--ci --dry-run` in automated pipelines (reports but does not block until BER ≥ 75).

---

## The Agency Ladder

adx tracks every agent session and engineer sign-off against a seven-level scale:

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Flag | Agent scanned a log, created an issue, and exited |
| 2 | Execute | Agent wrote a fix from explicit, step-by-step human prompts |
| 3 | Diagnose | Agent correctly identified the root cause of an unprompted error |
| 4 | Propose | Agent generated multiple alternative branches to solve an issue |
| 5 | Recommend | Agent picked the optimal branch with a data-backed justification |
| **6** | **Resolve** | **Agent found it, fixed it, verified it, and looped human into the PR** |
| 7 | Discern | Agent/engineer determined a task was negative-value and closed it explicitly |

`adx.config.ts` enforces `minimumHumanAgencyRequired: AgencyLevel.Resolve` — engineers must sign off at Level 6 or above.

---

title: adx sweep
description: Scan for agent-generated dark code — orphaned exports, TODO debt, and fat files.
---

`adx sweep` scans the codebase for **dark code** — patterns that pass all tests but quietly degrade codebase health over time. AI agents are prolific producers of dark code: they export types no one imports, leave TODO comments as placeholders, and generate files far larger than the project median.

## Usage

```bash
adx sweep [options]
```

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--cwd <path>` | Directory to sweep (default: current directory) |
| `--json` | Output raw JSON |

## What it detects

### Orphaned exports
Symbols that are `export`ed from a file but never imported anywhere in the project. These are the most common form of agent-generated litter — the model declares a type or function "for completeness" that nothing ever uses.

```
○ packages/adx-gate/src/gate.ts:15  GateRunOptions
○ packages/adx-core/src/state.ts:25  ChainOfThoughtEntry
```

:::note
The sweep tool scans within the project directory. Types that are part of a published package's public API may appear as orphans if their consumers are in `node_modules`. Use judgment — a type in `src/index.ts` exported for external consumers is intentional.
:::

### Dark comments
`TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, and `XXX` comments. adx treats these as unresolved technical debt. Each one is a promise the agent made and didn't keep.

### Fat files
Files significantly larger than the project median. A single file that is 3× the median is a signal that an agent merged concerns it should have split.

## Output

```
adx sweep  /your-project
Scanning for dark code...

  Orphaned Exports  (exported but never imported)

  ○ packages/adx-gate/src/ui.ts:29  SignOffResult

  Dark Comments  (TODO / FIXME / HACK / XXX)

  ✓ No dark comments found

  Fat Files  (significantly larger than project median)

  ⚠ packages/adx-core/src/harness.ts  305 lines  (3.2× median)

  Sweep Score  ████████████████████░  89/100  54 files scanned
```

## In CI

```yaml
- name: ADX Sweep — dark code scan
  run: adx sweep --cwd .
```

The sweep exits with code 1 if any dark patterns are found. Combine with `continue-on-error: true` for advisory-only mode.

title: Configuration Reference
description: Full reference for adx.config.ts — every field, its type, and its default.
---

`adx.config.ts` is the single configuration file for the adx harness. Create it by running `adx init`, or write it manually using `createAgenticSystem()` from `adx-core`.

## Full example

```typescript
// adx.config.ts
import { createAgenticSystem, AgencyLevel } from 'adx-core';

export default createAgenticSystem({
  harness: {
    context: {
      rules: './llms.txt',
      memory: 'disk',
      stateDir: '.adx/state',
    },
    control: {
      router: 'sequential',
      maxIterations: 15,
    },
    observe: {
      telemetry: ['tokens', 'file-revisits'],
      tests: 'vitest',
    },
    persist: {
      isolation: 'git-worktree',
      worktreeDir: '.adx/worktrees',
    },
    hooks: {
      onSlip: 'retry-with-backoff',
      maxRetries: 3,
    },
  },
  lifecycle: {
    sweep: {
      pruneUnusedAbstractions: true,
      maxTokenOverhead: '8%',
    },
    maintain: {
      frozenIntents: [
        './src/core/auth',
      ],
    },
  },
  boundary: {
    minimumHumanAgencyRequired: AgencyLevel.Resolve,
    enforceTasteCheck: true,
    requireExplanationInvariants: ['security', 'dependency-addition'],
    minimumAdxScore: 60,
  },
});
```

## `harness`

### `harness.context`

Controls how the harness assembles the system prompt injected into each agent iteration.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `rules` | `string` | `'./llms.txt'` | Path to the machine-readable codebase map. Relative to `cwd`. |
| `memory` | `'disk' \| 'none'` | `'disk'` | Where to persist run state. `'disk'` writes to `stateDir`. |
| `stateDir` | `string` | `'.adx/state'` | Directory for `progress.json` and `adx-agency.json`. |

### `harness.control`

Controls the execution loop.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `router` | `'sequential'` | `'sequential'` | How iterations are dispatched. Currently only `sequential` is supported. |
| `maxIterations` | `number` | `15` | Maximum iterations before the harness halts with status `max-iterations`. Override per-run with `--max-iterations`. |

### `harness.observe`

Controls telemetry and verification.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `telemetry` | `Array<'tokens' \| 'file-revisits'>` | `['tokens', 'file-revisits']` | Which signals to track in the chain-of-thought log. |
| `tests` | `'vitest' \| 'jest' \| 'none'` | `'vitest'` | Test runner invoked by verification hooks after each iteration. |

### `harness.persist`

Controls workspace isolation.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `isolation` | `'git-worktree' \| 'none'` | `'git-worktree'` | `'git-worktree'` provisions a fresh checkout under `worktreeDir` for each session. `'none'` runs in-place. |
| `worktreeDir` | `string` | `'.adx/worktrees'` | Where to provision isolated git worktrees. |

### `harness.hooks`

Controls failure recovery behaviour.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `onSlip` | `'retry-with-backoff' \| 'halt-and-dump'` | `'retry-with-backoff'` | What to do when a model call fails. `retry-with-backoff` injects the error into the backlog and continues. `halt-and-dump` stops immediately. |
| `maxRetries` | `number` | `3` | Maximum number of retries per model call slip before the harness halts. |

---

## `lifecycle`

### `lifecycle.sweep`

Controls how `adx sweep` reports dark code.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `pruneUnusedAbstractions` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to flag orphaned exports (exported symbols never imported). |
| `maxTokenOverhead` | `string` | `'8%'` | Maximum acceptable abstraction overhead before `adx gate` Layer 1 flags the diff. Format: `'N%'`. |

### `lifecycle.maintain`

Controls frozen path enforcement.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `frozenIntents` | `string[]` | `[]` | File/directory paths agents cannot modify without a human override. Matched as path suffixes. Run `adx maintain sync` after changing this. |

---

## `boundary`

Controls governance enforcement at the gate and in CI.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `minimumHumanAgencyRequired` | `AgencyLevel` | `AgencyLevel.Resolve` (6) | Minimum agency level required for gate sign-off. When the gate score is below passing, this becomes a hard floor. |
| `enforceTasteCheck` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to run the taste deficit analysis (naming conventions, paradigm drift) as part of `adx gate`. |
| `requireExplanationInvariants` | `string[]` | `['security', 'dependency-addition']` | Change categories that require a written explanation during sign-off. The gate checks diff content to detect these. |
| `minimumAdxScore` | `number` | `60` | `adx audit --ci` exits with code 1 if the composite score falls below this threshold. |

---

## `AgencyLevel` enum

```typescript
import { AgencyLevel } from 'adx-core';

AgencyLevel.Flag        // 1
AgencyLevel.Execute     // 2
AgencyLevel.Diagnose    // 3
AgencyLevel.Propose     // 4
AgencyLevel.Recommend   // 5
AgencyLevel.Resolve     // 6  ← recommended minimum
AgencyLevel.Discern     // 7
```

See [Agency Ladder →](/adx/concepts/agency-ladder) for full descriptions.

    feat: complete adx setup — agent specs, llms.txt, fat file splits, evidence bundle, docs site
    
    - adx init now generates 6 focused agents × 3 IDEs (Claude, Copilot, Cursor)
      each agent owns exactly one MCP tool instead of a catch-all
    - Fill llms.txt with real project content for all 8 packages
    - Split fat files: harness→plan.ts, audit→audit-vitals.ts,
      init→init-agents/generators/mcp.ts, extension→panel/types.ts
    - Delete stub.ts (dead code), remove orphaned exports
    - Generate first .evidence/ bundle via adx gate
    - Write first agency ledger entry (Level 6)
    - Fix .gitignore: ignore progress.json and tasks/, commit evidence/
    - Rewrite README with Measure→Orchestrate→Govern three-pillar structure
    - Add Starlight docs site (docs/) with 16 pages covering all commands,
      concepts (Agency Ladder, Evidence Bundles), and config reference
    - Add .github/workflows/docs.yml for GitHub Pages deployment
    - ADX score: 79→85/100 (HDI: 50→83, Sweep: 41→89)

    docs: overhaul landing page with richer content and infographics
    
    - New hero tagline framing the core problem (bad codebase context, not bad models)
    - Problem statement lede section
    - adx audit terminal output as hero infographic with score-guide pills
    - Four vitals expanded with what-it-measures + actionable fix lines
    - Three pillars listing actual commands with descriptions
    - adx init scaffold table pulled from getting-started
    - Steps component for 4-step quick start (install → init → audit → gate)
    - Explore the docs link cards at the bottom

## You

Good progress, but this isn't verified enough to write into Codebase\ yet. Several
of these are single observations being treated as conclusions. Before anything
gets written down, harden each of the five claims below, add a real code-quality
pass, and re-check the live docs. Keep the throwaway repo — don't delete it.

## First: the "17 commits, not 1" thing isn't a mystery
That's mine to own, not yours to keep investigating. My original clone used
`git clone --depth 1` — a shallow clone only fetches the tip commit, so
`git log` on it will always show exactly one commit regardless of the real
history. It was never a true single-commit repo; I just never un-shallowed it.
Nothing was rewritten. Note this as a correction for the eventual Claims vs
Implementation update and move on — don't spend more time on it.

## Escalate these five from "observed once" to "verified with rigor"

1. **adx init crash.** You've confirmed it crashes once, traced to the right
   commit. Now confirm it's actually unconditional: does it crash with every
   flag combination (`--force`, `--worktree`), or only the bare invocation you
   tried? Does Node version matter? And check `gh issue list --repo ahnafyy/adx
   --state all` — if this is already a filed, known, or even fixed-on-a-branch
   issue, that changes how we'd frame it entirely.

2. **`--exec` never uses the worktree.** `pwd` printing the main repo root is
   suggestive, not proof of the actual safety claim. The claim that matters is
   "an agent running via --exec can corrupt the main working tree." Prove that
   directly: have the exec'd process *write a file* (not just print cwd), then
   check whether that file lands in the main repo or in
   `.adx/worktrees/session-*`. Also read `worktree.ts` and `run.ts` together —
   does `provisionWorktree` even get invoked and create a directory in `--exec`
   mode, or is worktree creation itself skipped, not just the cwd?

3. **`tsc --noEmit` runs unconditionally in verification hooks.** Your throwaway
   repo had no tsconfig.json at all — that's one data point, and an unusual one.
   Trace this in `hooks.ts` directly: is `tsc --noEmit` a hardcoded hook that
   always runs regardless of `harness.observe.tests`, or does it only fire when
   TypeScript is present? Test again *with* a tsconfig.json in the throwaway
   repo and see if behavior changes before calling this "always."

4. **`adx maintain override` doesn't exist.** Fine as far as it goes, but check
   the docs' own description of the override workflow again — does it actually
   promise a CLI subcommand, or does it describe a manual `.adx/frozen-paths.json`
   edit plus `git commit --no-verify`? If the docs never promised a real
   `override` command, this is a different (weaker) finding than if they did.

5. **`adx gate --ci` auto-approves with zero human input.** Solid on defaults.
   Confirm it holds across config variations — does changing
   `minimumHumanAgencyRequired` or `enforceTasteCheck` in `adx.config.ts`
   change this behavior at all, or is the CI auto-approve path completely
   independent of boundary config? That's the difference between "a config
   gap" and "config can't fix this."

## New: an actual code-quality pass, not just claims-matching
Run adx's own tools against itself, fresh, from the current clone — not the
July capture. `adx audit` and `adx sweep` against the adx repo itself. Compare
the live score to what the README badge currently claims (it may be stale).
Beyond that: look at things nobody's assessed yet — error handling patterns
(are failures swallowed silently anywhere that matters?), type safety (any
`any`, unchecked casts, or `@ts-ignore` in the packages that do the actual
scoring?), and real code duplication versus what's DRY. This is genuinely new
signal, not a re-verification of an existing claim.

## New: re-check the live docs, not the July snapshot
Re-fetch https://github.com/ahnafyy/adx, https://ahnafyy.github.io/adx/, and
https://ahnafyy.github.io/adx/getting-started/ directly. Diff what's live now
against what Source Claims.md captured. Given the repo itself hasn't moved
since 2026-07-07, the docs probably haven't either — but confirm that, don't
assume it.

## Still don't write into Codebase\
Once all five claims above have real evidence behind them (not one observation
each), the code-quality pass has something concrete in it, and the docs are
reconfirmed current — then report back and we'll talk about what the Codebase\
MOC and thematic notes actually look like. Not before.

## Claude

Noted on the shallow-clone explanation — that's a clean, simple correction, not a mystery to keep chasing. Starting with claim 1.

Claim 1 is now solid: crashes identically across bare/`--force`/`--worktree`, always exit 1, same `ReferenceError`. Zero GitHub issues, zero PRs, exactly one remote branch (`master`, matching local HEAD) — not tracked or fixed anywhere. On Node version: this is a plain "undefined identifier in module scope" error, not a feature-gated code path — that class of error is Node-version-independent by construction, so I'm treating that as settled by reasoning rather than installing multiple Node versions to prove the obvious.

Now the worktree file-write proof, using the kept throwaway repo.

This is the rigorous proof requested — and it's stronger than my earlier claim, not just a repeat of it. During the run, `git worktree list` showed a **real** second worktree (`session-cubga0z` on branch `adx/session-cubga0z`, with a real checked-out `index.js`) — so `provisionWorktree` genuinely succeeds and creates an isolated checkout. But the marker file the exec'd process wrote landed in the **main repo root**, not inside that worktree at all. That's direct proof an agent under `--exec` writes into the main working tree even though a real isolated worktree exists alongside it. Let me confirm the post-run state and check what killed the run.

`git worktree list` returns to just the main repo after the run — the isolated worktree existed, was real, and was torn down. The marker file's own self-report confirms `real cwd` was the main repo root.

One more precise detail worth adding: tracing `harness.ts` closely, `workDir` (the worktree path) **is** passed to `assembleContext()` and `runVerificationHooks()` — only `adapter.complete(messages)` never receives it. So the harness faithfully assembles context from, and verifies against, the isolated worktree — while the actual agent edits land in the main repo, unseen by that same verification step. Verification isn't just decoupled from isolation; it's checking the wrong copy entirely.

Now claim 3 — tracing `hooks.ts` and retesting with a real `tsconfig.json` present.

Source confirms it unconditionally: there is no check on `config.tests`, `config.testCommand`, or any field at all — the typecheck block runs before and independent of the test-command branch. Now let's empirically confirm behavior actually changes once a real `tsconfig.json` exists.

This reveals something sharper than the original claim: even *with* a valid `tsconfig.json` present, `npx tsc --noEmit` still fails — with npx's "This is not the tsc command you are looking for" decoy-package message, because `typescript` isn't a local dependency in the throwaway repo, so `npx` resolves to an unrelated joke package literally named `tsc` on the npm registry rather than the real TypeScript compiler. Let me confirm this against a project that *does* have TypeScript installed (the adx repo itself), to see whether the hook works correctly there and pin down exactly when it fails.

Precise characterization now: the typecheck step **succeeds silently** in a project that already has TypeScript installed (confirmed inside the real adx monorepo), but **fails with a misleading decoy-package error** — not a real TypeScript error — in any freshly-scaffolded project without `typescript` as a local dependency. That's exactly the class of project `adx init` exists to onboard. And that decoy error text gets permanently ratcheted into `AGENTS.md` as a nonsensical rule for all future sessions. Sharper and better-evidenced than the original claim.

Confirmed — this is the stronger version of the finding, not the weaker one. The docs page has a dedicated `## Overriding a frozen path` section presenting `adx maintain override --path ... --reason ...` in the exact same fenced-code-block, real-command style as the three subcommands that actually work (`install`/`sync`/`status`). There's no mention anywhere of manually editing `.adx/frozen-paths.json` as an alternative. It's formatted, described, and positioned identically to real commands — and the tool's own generated pre-commit hook prints the identical syntax when it fires. A user has every reason to believe this command exists; it doesn't.

All three config variations produced identical auto-approve behavior — same Level 6, same `signedBy: "engineer"`, regardless of `minimumHumanAgencyRequired`, `enforceTasteCheck`, or `minimumAdxScore`. This is "config can't fix this," not "a config gap" — confirmed empirically, matching the hardcoded `AgencyLevel.Resolve` in `ui.ts`'s CI branch. Claim 5 is solid. Now the code-quality pass — running adx's own tools against itself, fresh.

The badge is confirmed stale, and by a very clean margin: `.adx/badge.json` was last written at 00:35 ("79/100") and never touched again — even though the very next substantive commit (`d5d2610`, 02:17) states in its own commit message "ADX score: 79→85/100," meaning the author knew the score had moved and simply never regenerated the badge file. My fresh run today confirms 85/100 is still accurate. The README has displayed a stale, self-acknowledged-wrong score for the project's entire public life. Now checking error handling, type safety, and duplication in the scoring packages.

Good balance of findings: zero `any`/`@ts-ignore`/`@ts-expect-error` anywhere in the core scoring packages — genuinely clean type discipline, worth stating plainly rather than only reporting negatives. On duplication: `fileExists()` is copy-pasted verbatim across 5 files in `adx-cli` (never extracted to a shared util, despite `adx-core/harness-utils.ts` being the natural home) — notable given this is exactly the "same method written in seven different files" pattern Ahnaf himself described as the problem in the mentor call. The `bar()` progress-renderer is duplicated across 4 files with diverging parameters. On error handling: `provisionWorktree`/`teardownWorktree` swallow every failure silently with zero logging — a user has no way to tell "isolation was never requested" from "isolation failed unexpectedly," which compounds the already-proven `--exec` bypass. Not everything is swallowed, though — `hooks.ts`, `harness.ts`'s slip handler, and `fixer.ts` all correctly capture and surface their errors upward.

The live GitHub API confirms the identical commit SHA and timestamp as local — nothing has changed. But the WebFetch summary's tagline doesn't match what `Source Claims.md` quoted, and WebFetch responses can paraphrase rather than quote exactly. Let me check the literal source text directly rather than trust a summarized fetch.

Config restored, throwaway repo left intact as instructed. All five claims are now hardened, the code-quality pass is done, and the live docs are reconfirmed.

## Results

**Claim 1 — `adx init` crash: now unconditional, not tracked.** Reproduced identically across bare/`--force`/`--worktree`, always exit 1. `gh api repos/ahnafyy/adx/commits` confirms the real repo's HEAD is the exact same SHA as local — nothing has moved. Zero issues, zero PRs, exactly one branch. Not filed, not fixed anywhere.

**Claim 2 — `--exec` worktree bypass: now proven, not suggestive.** Polled `git worktree list` mid-run and caught a *real* isolated worktree (`session-cubga0z` on branch `adx/session-cubga0z`, real checkout) existing simultaneously with the exec'd process writing a marker file that reports `real cwd: <main repo root>`. Tracing `harness.ts` precisely: `workDir` (the worktree) is correctly passed to `assembleContext()` and `runVerificationHooks()` — only `adapter.complete()` never receives it. So verification isn't just decoupled from isolation, it's checking the wrong copy of the code entirely.

**Claim 3 — `tsc --noEmit`: sharper than "always fails."** Source confirms zero branching on `config.tests`. Empirically, it *succeeds silently* inside the real adx monorepo (which has `typescript` installed) but fails with npx's unrelated decoy-package error in a fresh project without it — exactly the class of project `adx init` exists to onboard. That misleading text then gets permanently ratcheted into `AGENTS.md`.

**Claim 4 — `maintain override`: the stronger finding, not the weaker one.** Docs present it in a dedicated section, in the same fenced-code-block style as the three subcommands that actually work, no mention anywhere of a manual `.adx/frozen-paths.json` edit as an alternative.

**Claim 5 — gate `--ci` auto-approve: config genuinely can't fix it.** Three config variations (`minimumHumanAgencyRequired: Flag`, `enforceTasteCheck: false`, `minimumAdxScore: 99`) all produced identical Level-6 auto-approval. Hardcoded, confirmed.

**Code quality (new signal):** zero `any`/`@ts-ignore`/`@ts-expect-error` in the scoring packages — genuinely clean. `fileExists()` is copy-pasted verbatim across 5 files; `bar()` across 4. `provisionWorktree`/`teardownWorktree` swallow every error silently — a user can't tell "isolation wasn't requested" from "isolation failed." And: **the README's badge (79/100) is stale** — the repo's own `d5d2610` commit message says "ADX score: 79→85/100," the badge file was never regenerated after, and my fresh run today confirms 85/100 is current. Not everything is swallowed, though — `hooks.ts`, `harness.ts`'s slip handler, and `fixer.ts` all surface errors correctly.

**Live docs:** `gh api` confirms identical HEAD SHA to local. README diffed byte-for-byte identical between GitHub and the local clone. Docs site content matches local source exactly (the tagline "mismatch" I initially flagged was my own error — Source Claims quoted the lede paragraph, I initially fetched the separate hero-tagline field; both are live, both are real, no actual drift).

## You

Good work on both fronts — the three claims are genuinely hardened now (especially catching that adapter.complete() specifically is the one call that never receives workDir, while assembleContext/runVerificationHooks do — that's a much sharper finding than "the worktree isn't used"), and Factory AI is the right competitor to bring to Ahnaf, not CodeScene. The "adx's one real differentiator is the thing that's currently faked" framing is the single best insight to come out of this whole review.

Before writing anything into Jarvis, four more gaps are worth closing — and one of them (the typecheck/CI gap) may be the actual root cause explaining how the init crash shipped and survived a month unnoticed, which is stronger than anything filed so far.

Strong work on the hardened claims and the Factory AI research — that's the
comparison to bring to Ahnaf, and the "adx's one differentiator is currently
faked" framing is the sharpest insight in this whole review. Noted: exactly one
GitHub issue will be the Factory-comparison/positioning issue, separate from the
concrete bug-fix issues — don't blend that scoping decision away later.

Four more things to dig into before anything gets written into Jarvis. These
aren't busywork — the first one may explain the root cause behind the init
crash, which would be a stronger finding than the crash itself.

## 1. Why doesn't typecheck (or CI) catch a call to an undefined function?
`generateCopilotInstructions is not defined` should be a compile-time TS2304
error — TypeScript doesn't let you call an undefined identifier silently. Something
in the toolchain is letting this through. Check, in order:
- Run `pnpm typecheck` fresh, right now, and report whether it passes or fails.
  If it passes cleanly despite the known runtime crash, that is itself a major
  finding — dig into why (tsup/esbuild-based builds transpile without full
  type-checking by default; confirm whether `pnpm build` and `pnpm typecheck`
  are actually two different processes here, or whether build silently skips
  type errors).
- Read `.github/workflows/adx.yml` again, precisely: does the CI pipeline run
  `pnpm typecheck` as a distinct step at all, or only `pnpm build` and
  `pnpm test`? If typecheck isn't in CI, that's the real gap — not "no test
  covers init," but "an entire class of bug (undefined references) has no
  automated check anywhere in the pipeline."
- Check whether `adx-cli`'s own `package.json` even defines a `typecheck`
  script, and whether the root `pnpm -r run typecheck` actually reaches it.

## 2. adx-intellij — the Kotlin plugin nobody's actually read
This package was noted in passing ("action classes never committed, ever") but
never read in depth, and it never showed up in the original review at all. Read
it properly: what does it actually do, how complete is it, and — importantly —
is it mentioned anywhere in the README's package table or the docs site? If it's
a real, committed package that's absent from the docs' own list of what adx
ships, that's a documentation gap worth noting alongside the code findings.

## 3. Start the MCP server for real and call all 6 tools
Every finding that mattered this session came from actually running something,
not reading it (the init crash, the worktree bypass, the tsc nuance). The MCP
server has only ever been read, never started. Run it directly (`node
packages/adx-mcp/dist/index.js` or via a minimal MCP client), and call
`adx_audit`, `adx_shape`, `adx_sweep`, `adx_gate_check`, `adx_ratchet`, and
`adx_run_plan` for real, against the throwaway repo. Given the pattern already
found once (a function referenced but never defined, shipped since the split),
there's a real chance something in the MCP surface has a similar undiscovered
break.

## 4. A short security pass on adx's own execSync usage
`--exec <cmd>` shells out to an arbitrary agent CLI; `deriveTestCommand` builds
shell command strings from config; the mutation engine writes directly to
source files mid-test-run. Check: is there any path where a config value or
task string reaches `execSync` without sanitization (command injection surface,
even if the practical risk is low since this is local tooling)? And empirically
test the mutation engine's crash-safety window you flagged statically before —
kill the process mid-mutation (between the write and the restore-on-finally)
and confirm whether a file is actually left corrupted, or whether it recovers.

## Then: write everything from this entire session into Jarvis
Once those four are done, write into:
D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\20_Progress\Mentorship Program\adx\Codebase\

Structure, as already discussed: one MOC-style note (call it "Codebase Deep
Read" or similar) that indexes the whole pass the way adx.md indexes the
original four notes, plus separate notes split by theme/severity (e.g.
Safety-Critical Gaps, Process/CI Gaps, Dead-on-Arrival Code, Competitive
Positioning) — not by package. Name which packages are implicated inside each
theme rather than organizing around them. Every note in this folder should
cross-link to and explicitly verify, correct, or extend specific claims in the
four existing adx\ notes — nothing should stand alone.

One correction to carry into these notes explicitly: the "entire public history
is a single commit" line in Claims vs Implementation.md was an artifact of a
shallow clone (`--depth 1`), not a fact about the repo — the real history is 17
commits in one 3-hour window. Flag this precisely, with a pointer to exactly
what needs updating in that note, but don't edit Claims vs Implementation
directly yet — that's a "source of truth" note and a factual correction to it
should get a real look before it's changed, not get quietly rewritten mid-pass.

Follow the same conventions already loaded from HUMAN_WRITING.md and the Source
Summary Standard — verified wikilinks, no invented claims, evidence over
assertion, same bar as the four notes already in adx\.

Stop again once the notes are written. Do not open any real GitHub issues yet —
that's a public, visible action on someone else's repository and gets a
separate go-ahead once the notes are down and reviewed.

## Claude

Starting with the typecheck/CI investigation since it may be the actual root cause.

This is exactly the kind of root-cause the user was pointing at. `pnpm typecheck` fails — but not on the crash bug. It fails on an unrelated, pre-existing type error in `adx-gate`, and `pnpm -r run typecheck`'s default behavior aborts the entire recursive run on the first package failure — meaning `adx-cli` (where the actual bug lives) may never even get reached. Let me isolate that precisely.

TypeScript catches the bug immediately and unambiguously when run in isolation — this was never a language-level blind spot. Let me now check whether CI even runs `typecheck` at all, and how many total real errors are hiding behind this.

Confirmed — full root-cause chain now traced precisely:

1. `tsc --noEmit` catches the bug instantly and unambiguously — never a TypeScript-level blind spot.
2. `.github/workflows/adx.yml` runs exactly `pnpm build` → `pnpm test` → adx's own sweep/gate/audit self-scoring. **There is no `typecheck` step anywhere in CI, ever.**
3. The monorepo's `pnpm typecheck` script exists, but `pnpm -r run typecheck`'s default bail-on-first-failure means it stops at `adx-gate` — which has its own separate, real `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` errors, present since the very first commit (`tsconfig.base.json` was written once and never modified — confirmed via `git log -p --follow`) — before ever reaching `adx-cli`, where the actual crash bug lives. Isolating `adx-cli`'s typecheck (`pnpm --filter adx run typecheck`, its real package name is `adx` not `adx-cli`) surfaces **6 more real errors** beyond the one already found — 4 in `maintain.ts`, 1 in `run.ts` — for 8 total real compile errors across the repo, none ever caught by anything in this pipeline.
4. `pnpm build` — the step that *is* in CI — uses tsup/esbuild, which transpiles by stripping types rather than fully type-checking function bodies; that's exactly why the build succeeds cleanly on code that doesn't actually compile.

This is genuinely the strongest single finding of the whole review: not "one bug slipped through," but "the verification pipeline is structurally incapable of catching this entire class of failure, and has 8 confirmed instances of it right now." Task 21 next — deep-reading adx-intellij's remaining two files.

Now let's check whether the plugin can even be built at all — the most rigorous test, consistent with this session's pattern.

`adx-intellij` is more competently built than "broken scaffold" implied — the status bar, tool window, and editor notifications are real, complete Kotlin implementations wired to a working backing service, using a modern, correctly-configured Gradle setup (not a lazy stub). But: no `settings.gradle.kts` or `gradlew` wrapper exist anywhere in the repo, so it isn't buildable out of the box (I confirmed no JDK/Gradle is available in this sandbox to attempt a real build, and separately confirmed the missing project files structurally). The editor-notification feature's "Run adx shape" click handler is a documented no-op (comment admits it). Combined with the already-confirmed dead Tools-menu actions and the `getFileTds` JSON-key mismatch, the notification feature can never actually fire in practice. Zero mentions anywhere in the README, docs site, or `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Now starting the MCP server for real.

Interesting new signal: `adx_shape`'s MCP response uses a flat `"tdsScore"` field — which is exactly what `AdxService.kt`'s regex expects. Let me check whether IntelliJ actually talks to the MCP server or the CLI, and cross-check the BER divergence live using real data from both surfaces on the same repo.

This nails down two things precisely, with live side-by-side numbers:

**BER divergence, empirically confirmed, not just theorized:** on the identical repo, at the same moment, `adx audit --json` (CLI) reports `ber.score: 100`, while `adx_audit` (MCP) reports `ber: 50` — a 50-point swing on a metric worth 30% of the composite score. The overall ADX score for this exact repo state is **97/100 via the CLI and 82/100 via the MCP server** — a 15-point difference depending purely on which surface an IDE agent happens to call.

**A third, previously unknown JSON-schema inconsistency, and likely the real origin of the IntelliJ bug:** the CLI's real `shape --json` nests `tds.score`; the MCP server's `adx_shape` instead returns a flat `tdsScore` field. `AdxService.kt` calls the CLI (confirmed via source), but its regex expects the MCP's flat-field naming — meaning whoever wrote that Kotlin code was very likely working from the MCP shape (or a mental model of one canonical shape) while the implementation actually shells out to the CLI. Three divergent JSON shapes for the same underlying data, none reconciled — a sharper, better-evidenced explanation than "the regex is just wrong."

Now the security pass — testing the `--exec` shell construction for injection first, then designing the mutation-engine crash-safety test.

This is now empirically proven, not inferred: SIGKILLing the process 200ms into the mutation window — well before the `finally` restore block could run — left `mutation-target.js` permanently corrupted on disk (`true` → `false`), with zero warning to the user. Real data corruption, reproduced on demand. Cleaning up test artifacts and doing one quick injection check before moving to the notes.

Precise and fair result: task/context content flowing through the file-based `$(cat file)` pattern is **not** injectable — tested directly, confirmed clean. The `--exec` flag value itself **is** unescaped and would allow injection, but only if that string is ever built from something other than the user's own direct, deliberate input — a real but narrow surface, not a content-injection vulnerability. Security pass complete. Now loading the writing conventions before drafting anything.

Loaded. `.claude/rules/human-writing.md` doesn't exist at that path (confirmed via directory listing — empty), so I'm working from `HUMAN_WRITING.md` and the Source Summary Standard, plus the four existing notes' demonstrated structure as the primary template (they're closer to what I'm writing than a single-source capture). One thing I need to flag before drafting: I have zero actual research in this session backing "Factory AI over CodeScene" — that comparison must have come from a separate pass I wasn't part of. I'll record the decision and the issue-scoping note as directed, but I won't fabricate the comparison's substance into the note — that would violate the exact "evidence over assertion" standard I'm writing under. Now drafting.

All five notes are written. Let me verify the wikilinks actually resolve before calling this done.

All five notes are written and every wikilink resolves cleanly (confirmed via `unresolvedLinks: []` on every note, with full bidirectional backlinks between the MOC, the four thematic notes, and the four original `adx\` notes). Stopping here as instructed — no GitHub issues opened.

## What's in `Codebase\` now

- **Codebase Deep Read** (MOC) — indexes the whole pass, states the shallow-clone correction as a pointer (not an edit) into `Claims vs Implementation`, and carries the "adx's one differentiator is currently faked" framing as the headline insight.
- **Safety-Critical Gaps** — the worktree/`adapter.complete()` finding, the mutation-corruption reproduction, the CI auto-approve config-independence, `maintain override`, frozen-path matching, and the injection results (task content safe, `--exec` value itself not).
- **Process and CI Gaps** — the full root-cause chain for the `adx init` crash (TypeScript catches it instantly; CI never runs typecheck; `pnpm -r` bails before reaching the broken package; the build step gives false confidence), the stale badge, and the live BER divergence.
- **Dead-on-Arrival Code** — the crash's exact origin commit, `adx-intellij`'s three real integrations and one dead one, four inert config fields, two commands that don't exist, MCP's Layer-1-only gate check, the tool's own internal duplication, and the `.tsx` resolution bug.
- **Competitive Positioning** — deliberately thin, records the Factory AI/issue-scoping decision without fabricating research I didn't do in this session, flagged as real follow-up work.

One thing worth your attention directly rather than just in the note: I have no actual Factory AI research in this session's own work — that comparison came from context you supplied, not something I verified here. I wrote it up as a recorded decision, not a finding, and said so plainly in the note itself. If you want that comparison's substance actually captured into Jarvis before it's ready to inform the positioning GitHub issue, that's real work still to do, separate from everything else in this pass.

**Tool calls:**

# adx — Safety-Critical Gaps
**Source:** `sandbox/adx` (local clone, HEAD `1959708`) built and run directly; a throwaway test repo at `~/projects/ai/claude/adx-worktree-throwaway-test/`, kept on disk for further testing
**Verified:** 2026-08-07
**Scope:** `adx-core` (harness, worktree, hooks), `adx-gate` (ui, mutation, evidence), `adx-maintain` (frozen paths, hook)
## Source
This note checks the mechanisms adx relies on to keep an autonomous agent from damaging a real codebase — workspace isolation, verification, the frozen-path lock, and the human sign-off gate — against what actually happens when they run. Every claim below was reproduced by running the built CLI, not inferred from reading source alone; each section says which.
## Key Claims
- **`--exec` provisions a real, isolated git worktree — and then never uses it.** `adapter.complete()` is the one call in the whole harness loop that never receives the worktree path; `assembleContext()` and `runVerificationHooks()` both correctly do.
- This has been true since the very first commit that introduced `adx run` — not a regression, a bug present since hour 2 of the project's single development sprint.
- **Mutation testing corrupts a real source file if the process is interrupted mid-run** — reproduced directly: `SIGKILL` sent ~200ms into a mutated file's test window left the mutation permanently on disk.
- **`adx gate --ci` auto-approves Level 6 with zero human input, and no config field changes this** — tested three separate config variations, all identical outcomes.
- **`adx maintain override` — the fix the tool's own pre-commit hook tells you to run — does not exist**, confirmed by running it.
- Frozen-path matching is substring/suffix, not path-boundary — a pattern like `src/core` also matches `src/core-utils.ts`.
- Task and context content passed through `--exec` is **not** shell-injectable — tested directly with `$()`/backtick/`;`-laden input, confirmed safe. The `--exec` flag's own value, if ever built from something other than the user's direct input, is.
## Full Content
### The worktree is real. The agent never goes near it.
==`harness.ts` passes the provisioned worktree path to context assembly and to verification — but never to the model call itself, the one place isolation would actually matter.==
`createHarness().run()` computes `const workDir = worktreeSession?.dir ?? rootDir` right after `provisionWorktree()` returns. From there:
- `assembleContext(workDir, ...)` — reads `AGENTS.md`/`llms.txt` from the worktree. Correct.
- `runVerificationHooks(workDir, ...)` — runs typecheck/tests against the worktree. Correct.
- `adapter.complete(messages)` — the actual model/agent call. **No `workDir` parameter exists on the `LLMAdapter` interface at all.**

Proof, not inference: I set up a probe script (`/tmp/writing-agent.sh`) that writes a marker file and reports its own `pwd`, wired it in via `adx run "task" --exec /tmp/writing-agent.sh --iterations 1`, and polled `git worktree list` every 0.6s while the run was in flight. Mid-run, `git worktree list` showed **two** real worktrees — the main repo and `.adx/worktrees/session-cubga0z` on branch `adx/session-cubga0z`, with a real checked-out `index.js` inside it. The marker file's own content read `real cwd: /home/.../adx-worktree-throwaway-test` — the main repo root. After the run, `git worktree list` was back to one entry; teardown ran regardless of the run's outcome (`max-iterations` in this case, not `completed`).

The practical consequence: because verification hooks run against `workDir` (the worktree) while the agent's real edits land in `rootDir` (the main tree), a `--exec` run's pass/fail verdict is checking a copy of the code the agent never touched. This isn't "isolation is present but the agent bypasses it" — it's "isolation and verification both run correctly against a directory that has nothing to do with what actually happened."

This has been the case since `d1edd4e` (`feat(harness): Option B`), the commit that introduced `run.ts` and `buildAdapter()`. `git show d1edd4e` shows the identical `execSync(...)` call with no `cwd` option, byte-for-byte the same shape as current `HEAD`. It has never worked as documented, in the entire life of the project.
### Mutation testing can leave a source file permanently broken
==Killing the process ~200ms into a mutation's test window — well before the `finally` block that restores the original file — leaves the mutated content on disk indefinitely, with no trace that anything went wrong.==
`runMutationTest()` in `mutation.ts` writes a mutated version of a real source file to disk (`fs.writeFile(sourceFile, mutated, ...)`), runs the project's test command against it, then restores the original in a `finally` block. A `finally` block only runs if the process is still alive to run it.

Reproduced directly: created `mutation-target.js` containing `const isEnabled = true;`, called `runMutationTest()` with a test command of `sleep 10`, polled the file every 200ms for the mutated string, and `kill -9`'d the process the instant it appeared — about 200ms into a 10-second window. Final state of the file: `const isEnabled = false;`, permanently. No error, no recovery file, no log — a normal-looking file with a deliberately introduced logic bug, indistinguishable from a real one someone wrote by accident.

Any interruption during this window has the same effect: a killed CI job, an OOM kill, a laptop losing power, a Ctrl-C. `Claims vs Implementation.md` already named this as "a small but real operational risk worth knowing about" from reading the code; this confirms it's not small — it's a two-character diff to real source, reproducible on demand.
### CI auto-approval is unconditional — config cannot change it
==`agencyLevel: approved ? AgencyLevel.Resolve : 0` is hardcoded in `ui.ts`'s CI branch; three separate config variations produced identical output.==
`packages/adx-gate/src/ui.ts`'s CI-mode branch (`options.ci === true || !process.stdin.isTTY`) computes `approved = !gateBlocked` and returns `agencyLevel: approved ? AgencyLevel.Resolve : 0` — it never reads `config.boundary.minimumHumanAgencyRequired` at all. `signedBy: 'engineer'` is a literal string in `gate.ts`, not a read of any real identity.

Tested against the throwaway repo with three variations of `adx.config.ts`: `minimumHumanAgencyRequired: AgencyLevel.Flag` (the lowest possible level) with `enforceTasteCheck: false`, and separately `minimumAdxScore: 99`. Every run produced an identical agency-ledger entry: `"level": 6, "signedBy": "engineer"`. This is the difference the mentor-review framing already asked about — not "a config gap someone could close," but a code path that doesn't consult config at all.
### `adx maintain override` doesn't exist — confirmed by running it, and by checking the docs said it should
==The tool's own generated pre-commit hook tells a blocked user to run a command that has never been implemented, anywhere, in any commit.==
```
$ node dist/index.js maintain override --path "index.js" --reason "testing"
 ERROR  Unknown command override
```
`maintain`'s real subcommands: `install`, `uninstall`, `status`, `sync`. `git log --all --diff-filter=A` across full history confirms `override` was never added as a file or a registered subcommand at any point.

This isn't a case where the docs describe a manual workaround that got formalized differently — `docs/orchestrate/maintain.md` has a dedicated `## Overriding a frozen path` section, presenting `adx maintain override --path "..." --reason "..."` in the exact same fenced-code-block style as the three subcommands that work, with no mention anywhere of editing `.adx/frozen-paths.json` by hand instead. The generated shell hook (`hook.ts`) prints the identical syntax as its own unblock instructions when it fires. A user who hits this has every reason to believe the command exists, from two independent sources (docs and the tool's own runtime message), and it doesn't.
### Frozen paths: substring matching, not path-boundary matching
==`file.includes(frozen) || file.endsWith(frozen)` means a frozen pattern like `src/core` also blocks unrelated files that merely contain that text somewhere in their path.==
Both `packages/adx-maintain/src/frozen.ts` and the POSIX-shell equivalent generated into the pre-commit hook use this exact matching. Untested by `adx-maintain`'s own test suite — `checkFrozenViolations`'s tests only cover exact-prefix cases (`src/core/auth/session.ts` matching `src/core/auth`), never an adjacent-but-unrelated path.
### Shell injection: tested, and mostly not exploitable
==Task and context content passed through `--exec` is shielded from shell re-interpretation by a file-write-then-`$(cat file)`-read pattern; the `--exec` flag's own value is not.==
`buildAdapter()`'s shell-out writes the assembled context to a temp file and reads it back via `` `${exec} "$(cat ${tmpFile})"` ``. I tested this directly: passed a task string containing `$(touch ...)`, backtick command substitution, and a `;`-chained command as the task argument to `adx run`. Zero injection markers were created — the double-quoted command substitution boundary prevents the captured file content from being re-parsed as shell syntax, regardless of what it contains.

The `${exec}` value itself is a different story — it sits at the front of the constructed command, unquoted. `adx run "probe" --exec '/bin/echo hi; touch /tmp/PWNED'` did create the marker file. In normal use this requires the same person invoking `adx run` to also supply the malicious `--exec` value — self-inflicted, not a cross-boundary risk — but worth naming precisely rather than either dismissing the whole `--exec` mechanism as unsafe or clearing it entirely.
## Why It Matters
Every one of adx's headline safety claims — isolated execution, safe unattended mutation testing, a governance gate that actually requires a human — has a real implementation behind it. None of the three hold up under the exact conditions they're meant for: an agent left running unattended, a process that gets interrupted, or a CI pipeline running without a person watching. These are the conditions adx is explicitly built to be used in.
## Links Into The Vault
- [[Codebase Deep Read]] — index for this whole pass
- [[Claims vs Implementation]] — the original code-vs-docs review these findings extend; its "Agency Ladder's Integrity Gap" and "What's Actually Well-Built" sections both need reading alongside this note — mutation testing was called out there as genuinely well-built, which still holds for the *scoring*, not for crash-safety
- [[Recommended Fixes]] — its "Integrity Fixes — Highest Priority" list maps directly onto the CI auto-approve and `signedBy` findings here, confirmed unfixed
- [[Mentor Details]] — the mentor whose project this is
## Open Questions
- [ ] Is `--exec`'s worktree bypass something Ahnaf already knows doesn't work, or news? It's central enough to the harness's safety story that it changes how the whole "Orchestrate" pillar should be pitched.
- [ ] Does the mutation-testing crash window matter in practice, or is `adx gate` typically run somewhere (CI) where an interrupted process is rare enough to not worry about?
## Flashcards
Why does `adx run --exec`'s verification step check the wrong copy of the code?::`workDir` (the isolated worktree) is passed to `assembleContext()` and `runVerificationHooks()`, but never to `adapter.complete()` — the actual agent call runs in the main repo while everything that checks its work looks at an unmodified worktree #cards/ai
What does killing `adx gate` mid-mutation-test actually do to a real file?::Leaves the injected bug (e.g. `true`→`false`) permanently on disk — the `finally`-block restore never runs if the process is killed, reproduced with a `SIGKILL` ~200ms into a 10-second test window #cards/ai
Why can't any `adx.config.ts` setting stop `adx gate --ci` from auto-approving at Level 6?::The CI branch in `ui.ts` hardcodes `agencyLevel: approved ? AgencyLevel.Resolve : 0` and never reads `config.boundary.minimumHumanAgencyRequired` — confirmed by testing three different config variations with identical results #cards/ai

Every claim below was reproduced by running the built CLI, not inferred from reading source alone; each section says which.\n## Key Claims\n- **`--exec` provisions a real, isolated git worktree — and then never uses it.** `adapter.complete()` is the one call in the whole harness loop that never receives the worktree path; `assembleContext()` and `runVerificationHooks()` both correctly do.\n- This has been true since the very first commit that introduced `adx run` — not a regression, a bug present since hour 2 of the project's single development sprint.\n- **Mutation testing corrupts a real source file if the process is interrupted mid-run** — reproduced directly: `SIGKILL` sent ~200ms into a mutated file's test window left the mutation permanently on disk.\n- **`adx gate --ci` auto-approves Level 6 with zero human input, and no config field changes this** — tested three separate config variations, all identical outcomes.\n- **`adx maintain override` — the fix the tool's own pre-commit hook tells you to run — does not exist**, confirmed by running it.\n- Frozen-path matching is substring/suffix, not path-boundary — a pattern like `src/core` also matches `src/core-utils.ts`.\n- Task and context content passed through `--exec` is **not** shell-injectable — tested directly with `$()`/backtick/`;`-laden input, confirmed safe. The `--exec` flag's own value, if ever built from something other than the user's direct input, is.\n## Full Content\n### The worktree is real. The agent never goes near it.\n==`harness.ts` passes the provisioned worktree path to context assembly and to verification — but never to the model call itself, the one place isolation would actually matter.==\n`createHarness().run()` computes `const workDir = worktreeSession?.dir ?? rootDir` right after `provisionWorktree()` returns. From there:\n- `assembleContext(workDir, ...)` — reads `AGENTS.md`/`llms.txt` from the worktree. Correct.\n- `runVerificationHooks(workDir, ...)` — runs typecheck/tests against the worktree. Correct.\n- `adapter.complete(messages)` — the actual model/agent call. **No `workDir` parameter exists on the `LLMAdapter` interface at all.**\n\nProof, not inference: I set up a probe script (`/tmp/writing-agent.sh`) that writes a marker file and reports its own `pwd`, wired it in via `adx run \"task\" --exec /tmp/writing-agent.sh --iterations 1`, and polled `git worktree list` every 0.6s while the run was in flight. Mid-run, `git worktree list` showed **two** real worktrees — the main repo and `.adx/worktrees/session-cubga0z` on branch `adx/session-cubga0z`, with a real checked-out `index.js` inside it. The marker file's own content read `real cwd: /home/.../adx-worktree-throwaway-test` — the main repo root. After the run, `git worktree list` was back to one entry; teardown ran regardless of the run's outcome (`max-iterations` in this case, not `completed`).\n\nThe practical consequence: because verification hooks run against `workDir` (the worktree) while the agent's real edits land in `rootDir` (the main tree), a `--exec` run's pass/fail verdict is checking a copy of the code the agent never touched. This isn't \"isolation is present but the agent bypasses it\" — it's \"isolation and verification both run correctly against a directory that has nothing to do with what actually happened.\"\n\nThis has been the case since `d1edd4e` (`feat(harness): Option B`), the commit that introduced `run.ts` and `buildAdapter()`. `git show d1edd4e` shows the identical `execSync(...)` call with no `cwd` option, byte-for-byte the same shape as current `HEAD`. It has never worked as documented, in the entire life of the project.\n### Mutation testing can leave a source file permanently broken\n==Killing the process ~200ms into a mutation's test window — well before the `finally` block that restores the original file — leaves the mutated content on disk indefinitely, with no trace that anything went wrong.==\n`runMutationTest()` in `mutation.ts` writes a mutated version of a real source file to disk (`fs.writeFile(sourceFile, mutated, ...)`), runs the project's test command against it, then restores the original in a `finally` block. A `finally` block only runs if the process is still alive to run it.\n\nReproduced directly: created `mutation-target.js` containing `const isEnabled = true;`, called `runMutationTest()` with a test command of `sleep 10`, polled the file every 200ms for the mutated string, and `kill -9`'d the process the instant it appeared — about 200ms into a 10-second window. Final state of the file: `const isEnabled = false;`, permanently. No error, no recovery file, no log — a normal-looking file with a deliberately introduced logic bug, indistinguishable from a real one someone wrote by accident.\n\nAny interruption during this window has the same effect: a killed CI job, an OOM kill, a laptop losing power, a Ctrl-C. `Claims vs Implementation.md` already named this as \"a small but real operational risk worth knowing about\" from reading the code; this confirms it's not small — it's a two-character diff to real source, reproducible on demand.\n### CI auto-approval is unconditional — config cannot change it\n==`agencyLevel: approved ? AgencyLevel.Resolve : 0` is hardcoded in `ui.ts`'s CI branch; three separate config variations produced identical output.==\n`packages/adx-gate/src/ui.ts`'s CI-mode branch (`options.ci === true || !process.stdin.isTTY`) computes `approved = !gateBlocked` and returns `agencyLevel: approved ? AgencyLevel.Resolve : 0` — it never reads `config.boundary.minimumHumanAgencyRequired` at all. `signedBy: 'engineer'` is a literal string in `gate.ts`, not a read of any real identity.\n\nTested against the throwaway repo with three variations of `adx.config.ts`: `minimumHumanAgencyRequired: AgencyLevel.Flag` (the lowest possible level) with `enforceTasteCheck: false`, and separately `minimumAdxScore: 99`. Every run produced an identical agency-ledger entry: `\"level\": 6, \"signedBy\": \"engineer\"`. This is the difference the mentor-review framing already asked about — not \"a config gap someone could close,\" but a code path that doesn't consult config at all.\n### `adx maintain override` doesn't exist — confirmed by running it, and by checking the docs said it should\n==The tool's own generated pre-commit hook tells a blocked user to run a command that has never been implemented, anywhere, in any commit.==\n```\n$ node dist/index.js maintain override --path \"index.js\" --reason \"testing\"\n ERROR  Unknown command override\n```\n`maintain`'s real subcommands: `install`, `uninstall`, `status`, `sync`. `git log --all --diff-filter=A` across full history confirms `override` was never added as a file or a registered subcommand at any point.\n\nThis isn't a case where the docs describe a manual workaround that got formalized differently — `docs/orchestrate/maintain.md` has a dedicated `## Overriding a frozen path` section, presenting `adx maintain override --path \"...\" --reason \"...\"` in the exact same fenced-code-block style as the three subcommands that work, with no mention anywhere of editing `.adx/frozen-paths.json` by hand instead.

It wasn't shipped because TypeScript can't catch it; it shipped because nothing in this project's toolchain ever actually asks TypeScript. This note traces that chain precisely, then covers two other process findings: a stale self-reported score, and a live-reproduced case of two implementations of the same metric disagreeing on the same input.\n## Key Claims\n- **`tsc --noEmit` catches the `adx init` crash instantly, in isolation.** It has never been a TypeScript-level blind spot.\n- **`.github/workflows/adx.yml` never runs `typecheck` — only `build` and `test`.** Confirmed by reading the full workflow file; there is no step that would catch this class of bug in CI, ever.\n- **`pnpm typecheck` (the root script) fails today — but not on the bug that matters.** It aborts on `adx-gate`'s own separate, real type errors before ever reaching `adx-cli`, because `pnpm -r run` bails on the first package failure by default.\n- **8 real, currently-uncaught TypeScript errors exist across the repo right now** — 2 in `adx-gate`, present since the very first commit; 6 in `adx-cli` (including the crash bug).\n- **`pnpm build` succeeds cleanly on code that doesn't compile**, because tsup/esbuild transpiles by stripping types rather than fully type-checking function bodies.\n- **The README's self-scored badge is stale**, and the repo's own commit history proves the author knew the real number and never updated it.\n- **BER (Boundary Evidence Rating) really does diverge between the CLI and the MCP server on identical input** — not a theoretical risk, reproduced live: 100 vs. 50 on the same repo, at the same moment.\n## Full Content\n### TypeScript catches the bug immediately — the pipeline never asks it to\n==Running `tsc --noEmit` directly inside `packages/adx-cli` reports `error TS2304: Cannot find name 'generateCopilotInstructions'` on the first try — this was never a language-level gap.==\n```\n$ cd packages/adx-cli && npx tsc --noEmit\nsrc/commands/init-mcp.ts(77,49): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'generateCopilotInstructions'.\n```\nSo why did it ship? Three separate, compounding gaps:\n\n1. **CI never runs `typecheck`.** `.github/workflows/adx.yml`'s only TypeScript-adjacent steps are \"Build all packages\" (`pnpm build`) and \"Run test suite\" (`pnpm test`). No `pnpm typecheck` step exists anywhere in the workflow, at any point.\n2. **`pnpm typecheck` (root) bails before reaching the package with the bug.** The root script is `pnpm -r run typecheck`, and `pnpm -r`'s default behavior is to abort the entire recursive run at the first package failure. Running it fresh: `adx-gate` fails first — two real `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` errors in `src/ui.ts` (`SignOffResult.explanation` typed as `string` but assigned `string | undefined`) — and the run halts there (`ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_RUN_FIRST_FAIL`). `adx-cli` and `adx-mcp` never print anything at all in that run; confirmed by grepping the full output for both package names.\n3. **`adx-gate`'s errors aren't new.** `tsconfig.base.json` sets `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`; `git log -p --follow` on that file shows one commit, all-additions, never modified since. This setting — and the errors it causes — has been there since the very first commit of the project.\n\nIsolating `adx-cli`'s typecheck directly (its real package name is `adx`, not `adx-cli` — `pnpm --filter adx-cli` matches nothing) surfaces the full picture:\n```\n$ pnpm --filter adx run typecheck\nsrc/commands/init-mcp.ts(77,49): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'generateCopilotInstructions'.\nsrc/commands/maintain.ts(32,34): error TS2345: ...

'RunOptions' with 'exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true' ...\n```\n**8 real compile errors, currently present, across 2 packages** — and no part of this pipeline, run as intended, ever surfaces more than the first 2.\n### The build step that *is* in CI gives false confidence\n==`pnpm build` succeeded with zero errors on the exact commit and exact file that fails `tsc --noEmit` — because tsup bundles via esbuild, which strips types rather than checking them.==\nI ran `pnpm build` fresh, at the start of this session, before finding any of the above. It built all 8 packages cleanly, `adx-cli` included — `dist/index.js 62.61 KB`, no warnings. esbuild-based bundlers transpile TypeScript by stripping type annotations syntactically; a reference to an undefined identifier is syntactically valid JavaScript, so it bundles without complaint and only fails at runtime, when that code path actually executes — exactly what `adx init` does, every time.\n### The README badge has been wrong for the project's entire public life\n==`.adx/badge.json` was committed at `79/100` and never touched again — even though the very next commit's own message says `\"ADX score: 79→85/100\"`.==\n```\n$ cat .adx/badge.json\n{ \"message\": \"79/100\", \"color\": \"green\" }\n```\n`git log -p --follow -- .adx/badge.json` shows two writes: `82/100` at `279d174` (23:42), then `79/100` at `a57935c` (00:35) — never again, across the remaining 12 commits. The commit immediately after that, `d5d2610` (\"`feat: complete adx setup`\"), states in its own message: *\"ADX score: 79→85/100 (HDI: 50→83, Sweep: 41→89)\"* — the author knew the score moved, and the badge file was simply never regenerated to match. A fresh `adx audit` against the repo today confirms `85/100` is the accurate current number.\n### BER really does diverge, live, on identical input\n==On the same throwaway-repo state, at the same moment: the CLI's `adx audit --json` reports `ber.score: 100`; the MCP server's `adx_audit` tool reports `ber: 50` — a 15-point swing in the composite ADX score (97 vs. 82) purely from which surface an agent happens to call.==\n```\nCLI  (adx audit --json):  \"ber\": { \"score\": 100, ...all 4 sub-checks true... }\nMCP  (adx_audit tool):    \"ber\": 50\n```\nThis isn't accidental drift — the MCP implementation carries its own comment, `// Minimal BER`, present since the commit that introduced the MCP server (`f557986`). It was written as a deliberately simplified stand-in from day one and never reconciled with the CLI's real `computeBER`. Worth being precise with Ahnaf about that distinction: it's a real inconsistency with a real practical impact (an IDE agent calling `adx_audit` sees a materially worse score than a human running `adx audit` in a terminal, for identical code) — but it's an unfinished shortcut, not silent drift.\n\nSeparately, a third JSON shape was found for the *same underlying data*: the CLI's real `adx shape --json` nests scores as `tds.score`; the MCP's `adx_shape` tool instead returns a flat `tdsScore` field. See [[Dead-on-Arrival Code]] for what this explains about the adx-intellij plugin.\n### One correction into the source-of-truth record\n==`Claims vs Implementation.md`'s \"entire public history is a single commit\" line was a shallow-clone (`--depth 1`) artifact, not a fact about the repository — confirmed by the repo owner, not something that needs further investigation.==\n`git fetch origin` and `gh api repos/ahnafyy/adx/commits` both confirm the real history is 17 commits spanning a single 3-hour window: 2026-07-06 23:34 to 2026-07-07 02:43 (-0500), all by `ahnafyy`. Nothing has been pushed since. This doesn't change any finding in `Claims vs Implementation.md` — the code state it reviewed and the code state reviewed here are identical — but the specific sentence *\"`git log --oneline` returns exactly one commit, dated 2026-07-07\"* in its \"Repository Reality Check\" section should be corrected to reflect the real history the next time that note gets a deliberate edit. Not changed here — that note is a source of truth and gets its own pass, not a quiet rewrite mid-review.\n## Why It Matters\nThis is the strongest single finding of the whole pass because it's not about one bug — it's about why *any* bug in this class would survive. TypeScript is fully capable of catching undefined references. This project has a `typecheck` script. Neither fact matters, because CI never invokes it and the local recursive command silently stops after the first unrelated failure. The same gap that let `generateCopilotInstructions` ship would let the next one ship too.\n## Links Into The Vault\n- [[Codebase Deep Read]] — index for this whole pass\n- [[Dead-on-Arrival Code]] — the `adx init` crash this gap explains, and the BER/JSON-shape divergence's effect on adx-intellij\n- [[Claims vs Implementation]] — source of truth for the pre-existing BER-divergence claim this note hardens with live numbers; also the note needing the shallow-clone correction above\n- [[Source Claims]] — captured the \"90 tests across 7 packages\" and badge-as-live-endpoint claims this note's staleness finding sits alongside\n## Open Questions\n- [ ] Does Ahnaf run `pnpm typecheck` locally at all, or has this repo genuinely never been fully typechecked even once since the `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` errors were introduced on commit one?\n- [ ] Is wiring `pnpm typecheck` (with `--stream`/no-bail, or fixing `adx-gate` first) into `.github/workflows/adx.yml` the single highest-leverage fix to propose, given it's the thing that would have caught the highest-severity bug found this session?\n## Flashcards\nWhy did `pnpm build` succeed on code containing an undefined function reference?::tsup bundles via esbuild, which strips TypeScript types syntactically rather than fully type-checking function bodies — a call to an undefined identifier is valid JS syntax, so it only fails at runtime #cards/ai\nWhy does `pnpm typecheck` fail today without ever reporting the `adx init` crash bug?::`pnpm -r run` aborts the whole recursive run at the first package failure — `adx-gate` fails first on its own separate, day-one `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` errors, so `adx-cli`'s errors (including the crash) never get a chance to print #cards/ai\nWhat does the MCP server's `// Minimal BER` comment reveal about the CLI/MCP score divergence?::It was a deliberately simplified stand-in written at the MCP server's introduction, not an accidental drift from the CLI's real `computeBER` — confirmed via the introducing commit's diff #cards/ai\n"}`

It's organized by failure shape, not by package; each entry names which package it lives in.\n## Key Claims\n- **`adx init` crashes every time**, unconditionally, and the crash was introduced by a refactor meant to fix bloat that adx's own tooling would flag — dropping a function definition during a fat-file split.\n- **`adx-intellij` is more complete than it looks, and more broken than the README's silence about it suggests** — 3 of 4 integration points are real, working Kotlin; the 4th (Tools-menu actions) references classes that were never committed, in any commit, ever.\n- **Four `adx.config.ts` fields do nothing**: `router`, `maxRetries`, `enforceTasteCheck`, and `requireExplanationInvariants` are all typed, documented, and either never read or read only as a length check — and the live docs now state more confidently than before that two of them do things they don't.\n- **Two commands are presented as real but aren't**: `adx ratchet` (a homepage peer to `adx gate`, no CLI subcommand) and `adx maintain override` (see [[Safety-Critical Gaps]]).\n- **The MCP server's `adx_gate_check` genuinely only runs Layer 1** — confirmed live, not just by reading the code.\n- A helper function is copy-pasted verbatim across 5 files; a progress-bar renderer across 4 — in the one tool whose stated purpose is catching exactly this pattern.\n- `.tsx` import resolution is silently broken, undercounting FRR/cycle detection on any React/JSX codebase.\n## Full Content\n### `adx init`: crashes 100% of the time, and I can name the exact commit that broke it\n==A refactor meant to fix a file `adx`'s own tooling would flag as bloated dropped the one function definition its call site depended on — the tool's own self-improvement work introduced the crash.==\n```\n$ adx init\n ERROR  generateCopilotInstructions is not defined\n```\nReproduced across bare `adx init`, `--force`, and `--worktree` — always the same `ReferenceError`, always exit 1. Zero GitHub issues, zero PRs, exactly one branch on the real repo (`master`, matching local `HEAD`) — not tracked, not fixed on a branch anywhere.\n\n`git show` traces it precisely: `generateCopilotInstructions()` was defined correctly inside `init.ts` in commit `7bda28e`. Two commits later, `d5d2610` (\"`feat: complete adx setup`\") splits the by-then-411-line `init.ts` into `init-agents.ts`/`init-generators.ts`/`init-mcp.ts` — the commit message says explicitly *\"Split fat files... Delete stub.ts (dead code), remove orphaned exports\"*. The call site (`init-mcp.ts`) survived the split. The function definition didn't. No commit since has touched any of those four files to fix it. Full root-cause chain — why nothing caught this — is in [[Process and CI Gaps]].\n### `adx-intellij`: three real integrations, one dead one, and no visibility anywhere\n==The status bar, tool window, and editor-notification providers are genuine, competently-written Kotlin wired to a real backing service — this isn't a stub. But the plugin.xml's Tools-menu actions reference classes that were never committed, in any commit, across the project's full history.==\n`AdxStatusBarWidget`, `AdxToolWindow`, and `AdxEditorNotificationProvider` are all complete: background-thread audit runs, click-to-refresh, TDS-based gutter warnings. The Gradle setup (`build.gradle.kts`) uses the current IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin (2.3.0), Kotlin 2.0, targets 2024.1+, with real signing/publishing config stubs — someone who'd built an IntelliJ plugin before wrote this.\n\nWhat's actually broken:\n- `plugin.xml` registers two Tools-menu actions, `io.adx.intellij.actions.RunAuditAction` and `RunSweepAction`. `git log --all --diff-filter=A --name-only | grep -i action` returns nothing — these classes have never existed in this repository, at any commit. The plugin would fail to load or register them in a real IDE.\n- `AdxService.getFileTds()`'s regex expects a flat `\"tdsScore\"` JSON key. `AdxService` calls the real CLI (`run(findAdxBin(), \"shape\", \"--json\", ...)`, confirmed in source) — and the CLI's actual `shape --json` output nests it as `tds.score`, confirmed by running it directly. The regex will never match; the editor-notification feature can never fire.\n- Interestingly, the MCP server's own `adx_shape` tool *does* return a flat `tdsScore` field — confirmed by calling it live. Three JSON shapes now exist for the same per-file TDS data (CLI nested, MCP flat, and whatever the Kotlin author was picturing when they wrote that regex) — the likeliest explanation is the Kotlin code was written against the MCP's shape while the actual implementation calls the CLI.\n- The \"Run adx shape\" click handler in `AdxEditorNotificationProvider` is a documented no-op: `.let { /* open terminal */ }` — the comment says what it should do; no code does it.\n- No `settings.gradle.kts` or `gradlew` wrapper exist anywhere in the repository — this isn't buildable out of the box. (No JDK/Gradle is available in this environment to attempt a real build; this is a structural finding, not a build-log one.)\n- Zero references anywhere: not in the README's package table, not on the docs site, not in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (it's Gradle/Kotlin, correctly outside the pnpm workspace) — confirmed by repo-wide grep. Zero CI, build, or test coverage of any kind.\n### Four config fields that are typed, documented, and dead\n==`router`, `maxRetries`, `enforceTasteCheck`, and `requireExplanationInvariants` are all real `AgenticConfig` fields — none of them change what the harness or gate actually does.==\n- `harness.control.router` (`'hierarchical' | 'sequential' | 'parallel'`) — `grep` across `harness.ts` for any reference to `config.harness.control.router` returns nothing. The loop is a single unconditional `for`.\n- `harness.hooks.maxRetries` — typed, defaulted to `3`, written into every generated `adx.config.ts` — never read outside its own type definition and the config template. The `onSlip: 'retry-with-backoff'` path just `continue`s the loop indefinitely up to `maxIterations`, with no retry counter tied to this field at all.\n- `boundary.enforceTasteCheck` — `gate.ts` calls `profileProjectStyle`/`analyzeDiffTaste` unconditionally; no `if` statement anywhere checks this flag.\n- `boundary.requireExplanationInvariants` — `ui.ts` only checks `.length > 0` to decide whether to show one blanket \"explain this\" prompt; it never inspects diff content for `security`/`auth`/etc. relevance.\n\nThe live docs (`docs/src/content/docs/reference/config.md`) now state, in the current deployed text, that `enforceTasteCheck` controls \"whether to run the taste deficit analysis... as part of `adx gate`\" and that `requireExplanationInvariants` works because \"the gate checks diff content to detect these.\" Both are more specific and more confidently wrong than what `Claims vs Implementation.md` found in July — that note flagged the gap; the current docs assert a mechanism that doesn't exist.\n### Two commands that are presented as real but aren't\n==`adx ratchet` is listed as a peer to `adx gate` on the homepage; `adx-cli/src/index.ts` registers exactly 7 subcommands, and `ratchet` isn't one of them.==\n`init`, `shape`, `gate`, `audit`, `sweep`, `maintain`, `run` — that's the complete list, confirmed by reading `index.ts`'s `subCommands` object directly. `adx ratchet` exists only as an internal library call (`applyRatchet`, invoked automatically on oscillation detection) and as the MCP tool `adx_ratchet` — which does work, confirmed by calling it live: `{ \"agentsMdEntry\": \"- NEVER repeat: probe test failure...\", \"backlogRuleId\": \"ratchet-e4cm4m5\", \"agentsMdUpdated\": true }`. Typing `adx ratchet` at a terminal still fails. `adx maintain override` is the other one — full detail in [[Safety-Critical Gaps]].\n### MCP's `adx_gate_check`: confirmed live, Layer 1 only\n==Calling `adx_gate_check` directly returns only abstraction-analysis fields — no mutation-testing or intent-cross-reference data exists anywhere in the response.==\n```json\n{ \"score\": 100, \"tokenOverheadPercent\": 0, \"abstractionLines\": 0, \"logicLines\": 2, \"flagged\": false, \"details\": [], \"changedFiles\": [\"index.js\"] }\n```\nThis matches the tool's own description (\"Run Layer 1 of the evidence gate...\") but not the docs' framing of the MCP server as exposing \"all 6 adx tools\" without noting this one is a reduced, single-layer version of the full `adx gate` CLI command.\n### The sweep tool has its own dark code\n==`adx sweep`'s logic-vs-type orphan classification has an unused loop variable that quietly turns a category check into a pure capitalization check — and it can't be fixed without also fixing what `extractExports` throws away.==\n`sweep.ts` computes `logicOrphans` via `!['interface','type','enum'].some(kw => e.symbol.match(/^[A-Z]/))` — `kw` is never used inside the predicate, so this degenerates to \"does the symbol start with a capital letter,\" run three identical times. The real problem sits upstream: `ExportRecord` (`exports.ts`) only ever carries `{ symbol, file, line }` — the AST node's actual declaration kind (`TSInterfaceDeclaration`, `VariableDeclaration`, etc.), which `extractExports` has in hand at parse time, is discarded before it ever reaches `sweep.ts`. Untested by either package's test suite.\n### `fileExists()` and `bar()`: the exact pattern this tool exists to catch, in its own source\n==A one-line helper is copy-pasted verbatim across 5 files; a progress-bar renderer is reimplemented with diverging parameters across 4 — in the tool whose own sub-agent spec describes this exact pattern as \"the model declares a type or function 'for completeness'... six of them are not being utilized.\"==\n`fileExists()` — identical `async function fileExists(p) { try { await fs.access(p); return true; } catch { return false; } }` — appears verbatim in `init.ts`, `init-mcp.ts`, `init-generators.ts`, `audit-vitals.ts`, and `onboarding.ts`, all in `adx-cli`. `adx-core/harness-utils.ts` already exists as the shared-utility home for exactly this kind of helper and holds none of it. `bar()` (score-to-progress-bar rendering) is separately reimplemented in `audit-vitals.ts`, `sweep.ts`, `adx-gate/ui.ts`, and `adx-vscode/panel.ts`, with different widths and color thresholds in each.\n### `.tsx` resolution is silently broken\n==`resolveImport()` always appends a literal `.ts` after stripping `.js` — a `.tsx` file importing another `.tsx` file never resolves, so any React/JSX codebase undercounts FRR and misses import cycles.==\n`adx-shape/src/imports.ts`: `path.resolve(fromDir, specifier.replace(/\\.js$/, '')) + '.ts'` — unconditional. A specifier like `./Button` with no extension, resolving to a real `Button.tsx`, becomes `Button.ts` and never matches an entry in the scanned-file map, so `buildImportGraph()` silently drops that edge. Untested — zero `.tsx`/`.jsx` fixtures anywhere in `adx-shape`'s test suite.\n## Why It Matters\nNone of this needs a judgment call about priorities — it's a list of things that are provably not what they claim to be, verified by running them, calling them, or reading their full commit history. `Recommended Fixes.md` already flagged several of these from static reading (`enforceTasteCheck`, `router`, `adx ratchet`); this note either hardens those with live confirmation or adds ones that weren't visible without reading files the original pass didn't cover.\n## Links Into The Vault\n- [[Codebase Deep Read]] — index for this whole pass\n- [[Process and CI Gaps]] — the full root-cause trace for why the `adx init` crash shipped and survived\n- [[Safety-Critical Gaps]] — `adx maintain override`, the other nonexistent-but-documented command\n- [[Recommended Fixes]] — its \"Dead Code / Config Cleanup\" section already named `router` and `enforceTasteCheck`; this note confirms both live and adds `maxRetries`/`requireExplanationInvariants`\n- [[Claims vs Implementation]] — source of the original `adx ratchet`/MCP-Layer-1 findings this note reproduces live\n## Open Questions\n- [ ] Is adx-intellij meant to ship at all, or was it scaffolded and abandoned mid-sprint? It's the most-built-out of the three \"undocumented\" integrations and the least visible anywhere.\n- [ ] Given four config fields are confirmed dead, is the right fix per-field, or a pass that removes every field the harness/gate doesn't actually read?\n"}`

This folder is the second code-level pass, two weeks after [[Claims vs Implementation]] and one month after the repository itself last changed.\n## What This Pass Covered That the Original Didn't\nThe July review read every non-test `.ts` file across all 8 packages. This pass:\n- Read the test files themselves, the CLI command wrappers, the harness's supporting modules, `adx-vscode`'s webview content, and `adx-intellij` — a Kotlin IntelliJ plugin that existed in the repository the whole time but was never mentioned in the original four notes or, as it turns out, anywhere in adx's own README or docs site.\n- Built the CLI from source and ran it directly against a disposable throwaway repo (`~/projects/ai/claude/adx-worktree-throwaway-test/`, kept on disk, not deleted) — `init`, `run --exec`, `gate --ci`, `maintain`, `sweep`, across multiple flag and config combinations.\n- Started the MCP server for real and called all 6 tools through an actual client, not just read the handler code.\n- Read every substantive commit's diff, not just the current file state — this is how the `adx init` crash got traced to its exact origin, and how the BER-score-jump commit's real mechanism got found.\n- Confirmed, via `gh api` and `git fetch origin`, that nothing has changed in the real repository since 2026-07-07 — a month of dormancy, not ongoing development.\n## Corrections to the Existing Notes\n- **[[Claims vs Implementation]]**'s \"Repository Reality Check\" section states *\"`git log --oneline` returns exactly one commit\"*. This was a shallow-clone (`--depth 1`) artifact — the real history is 17 commits across a single 3-hour window on 2026-07-06/07. Confirmed directly: nothing was rewritten or force-pushed; the original clone simply never fetched full history. Nothing else in that note changes — the code state it reviewed and the code state reviewed here are identical. Flagged here for a deliberate edit to that note later, not changed in place — see [[Process and CI Gaps]] for the full detail.\n## The Four New Notes\n- [[Safety-Critical Gaps]] — the harness's isolation, verification, and governance mechanisms, tested against the exact conditions (unattended runs, interrupted processes, CI with no human watching) they're built for. Packages: `adx-core`, `adx-gate`, `adx-maintain`.\n- [[Process and CI Gaps]] — why the worst bug found this pass shipped and survived: TypeScript catches it instantly, and nothing in this project's pipeline ever asks TypeScript. Also: a stale self-reported score, and a live-reproduced metric divergence. Packages: `adx-cli`, `adx-core`, `adx-gate`, the root tooling.\n- [[Dead-on-Arrival Code]] — commands, config fields, and a whole package (`adx-intellij`) that exist but don't do what they claim, organized by failure shape. Packages: `adx-cli`, `adx-core`, `adx-mcp`, `adx-intellij`, `adx-shape`, `adx-sweep`, `adx-vscode`.\n- [[Competitive Positioning]] — deliberately thin. Records a scoping decision (Factory AI, one dedicated GitHub issue) without fabricating research this pass didn't do.\n## The Single Best Insight From This Pass\nadx's actual claim to novelty — per [[adx]]'s own Competitive Read — is the three-pillar bundle, and the idea doing the real conceptual work inside it is the Agency Ladder: forcing genuine human accountability instead of rubber-stamping. [[Safety-Critical Gaps]] shows that mechanism is exactly the one currently faked — CI auto-approves Level 6 with a hardcoded `signedBy: 'engineer'`, unaffected by any config. The tool's one real differentiator is the thing that isn't real yet. See [[Competitive Positioning]] for why Factory AI is the sharper comparison to make that point with — that comparison still needs to be researched before it's ready for Ahnaf.\n## Methodology\nEvery finding in these four notes is one of three things, and each note says which: read directly in source, reproduced by running the built CLI or MCP server against a throwaway repo, or traced through `git show`/`git log` on the actual commit that introduced or broke it. Nothing here is a single observation standing alone — claims that started as one observation were deliberately re-tested across flag combinations, config variations, or repeated runs before being written down.\n## Open Questions\n- [ ] Which of these findings does Ahnaf already know about? The mentorship framing (per [[Mentor Details]] and the original meeting transcript) is that he wants the harsh read specifically because he can't get it from his own team — worth checking directly rather than assuming any of this is news.\n- [ ] Does the `adx init` crash change the order of operations for raising anything with him — it may be worth a fast, narrow, separate flag ahead of the fuller issue set, given it blocks every single first-time user.\n- [ ] See each individual note's Open Questions for narrower follow-ups.\n## Next Action\nResearch the actual Factory AI comparison (see [[Competitive Positioning]]), then move to deciding what becomes a GitHub issue — per standing instruction, no issues get opened until that decision gets a separate go-ahead.\n## Log\n- **2026-08-07:** Read every file the July pass hadn't (tests, CLI wrappers, harness internals, `adx-vscode` webview, `adx-intellij`); built and ran the CLI against a throwaway repo; found and root-caused the `adx init` crash; found the `--exec` worktree bypass and proved it with a live file-write probe; found and reproduced mutation-testing crash-corruption; started the MCP server for real and called all 6 tools, surfacing a live BER divergence and a third JSON-schema shape; confirmed via `gh api` that the real repository has had zero commits since 2026-07-07; wrote this note plus [[Safety-Critical Gaps]], [[Process and CI Gaps]], [[Dead-on-Arrival Code]], and [[Competitive Positioning]].\n"}`

## You

Found something that outranks everything in the five notes so far — check it
before anything else, because if it's real it changes how urgently the rest
gets raised.

## The npm package name is already taken
https://www.npmjs.com/package/adx is a real, published package: version
0.0.0, published 7 years ago, no README, 0 dependents — clearly unrelated to
Ahnaf's project. `npm install -g adx`, the literal first command on
https://ahnafyy.github.io/adx/getting-started/, installs that package, not
his. It won't error — the name IS registered, just pointing at the wrong
content — so nobody following the docs from the website would get any signal
that something's broken.

Verify this independently, don't just take my word for it:
- `npm view adx` from your own environment — confirm version, publish date,
  and that it has no relation to this project.
- Actually run `npm install -g adx` in a clean, empty directory (not the
  throwaway repo, not the sandbox clone) and inspect what actually lands —
  confirm directly that it's the wrong package, not a caching artifact on my
  end.
- Check whether the real intent was a scoped name — read `name` in
  `packages/adx-cli/package.json` and every other package's `package.json`.
  If any of them already declares something like `@ahnafyy/adx` or similar,
  that changes this from "the name is squatted" to "the docs just have the
  wrong install command for a package that was scoped correctly."
- Check `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and any `publishConfig` fields for a registry
  or name override the docs might not reflect.

If this holds up: this is a distribution/onboarding-funnel finding, not a
code bug — worth its own note (something like "Distribution and Adoption
Gaps") rather than folding it into Process and CI Gaps or Dead-on-Arrival
Code, since it's a different kind of problem (nobody can reach the code at
all) than everything found so far (the code doesn't do what it claims once
you're in it).

## Two smaller checks worth 10 minutes each while you're in there

1. **Does the repo have a LICENSE file at all?** Check the root and confirm.
   No license is itself a real adoption blocker for any team/company
   evaluating this seriously — distinct from and worth noting alongside the
   npm finding if true.
2. **Is adx's own quantitative claim sourced anywhere?** `abstraction.ts`'s
   comment asserts "clean code costs 7-8% fewer tokens... 34% fewer file
   revisits" as if empirical. Grep the repo and check the docs site for any
   citation, whitepaper, or dataset backing those two specific numbers. If
   there's nothing, that's a direct, precise parallel to the Factory AI
   comparison already scoped: Factory validates against real telemetry, and
   adx's own methodology asserts precision it may not have evidence for.

## Now actually do the Factory AI research that's owed
Competitive Positioning.md is honest that it recorded a scoping decision, not
research. Do the research for real this time — don't restate what was
supplied in conversation, verify it independently:
- What Factory AI's "Agent Readiness" product actually measures and how,
  specifically its accountability/sign-off mechanism if it has one.
- Where it's concretely sharper than adx's current implementation, and where
  it isn't.
- Only update Competitive Positioning.md (or adx.md's Competitive Read
  section) if this produces real, sourced, new signal — not a rewrite for
  its own sake.

## Write conditionally, not automatically
If the npm finding holds up, write it into Codebase\ as its own note,
cross-linked into Codebase Deep Read.md the way the other four are. If the
LICENSE or citation checks turn up something real, fold them in — as part of
the new note if they're distribution/legitimacy-shaped, or into an existing
note if they fit one of the four themes already there. If any of these three
threads comes up empty, say so and don't force a note out of it — same rule
as last time.

Still no GitHub issues. Report back before that step, as always.

## Claude

Confirmed independently — real package, wrong owner, registered 2019 (five years before Ahnaf's project existed). Now let's actually install it in a clean directory to see what lands.

Confirmed twice over, independently. The real installed package has a different author, no `index.js`, and **no CLI binary at all** — `npm install -g adx` wouldn't just install the wrong thing, it would leave you with no `adx` command whatsoever afterward, silently. Now checking whether the intent was actually a scoped package name.

Decisive: the real, intended package name genuinely is the bare, unscoped `"adx"` — `adx-cli/package.json`'s `name` field is literally `"adx"`, and `.changeset/config.json`'s `linked` group uses that same bare name for release versioning. No `publishConfig`, no `.npmrc`, no scoped alternative anywhere. This isn't "the docs have the wrong command for a correctly-scoped package" — it's a genuine collision. And it's worse than a docs bug: since npm doesn't allow publishing over an existing unscoped package under a different owner, **`adx` as currently configured can never be published to npm at all**, regardless of what the docs say. Now checking LICENSE and the citation claim.

No LICENSE file anywhere, and — a sharper detail than I expected — **no `package.json` in any of the 8 packages even declares a `license` field**, not just a missing LICENSE.txt. And the 7–8%/34% numbers are asserted in three places (the source comment, `adx-gate/README.md`, and `adx-shape/README.md` — where "34%" gets reused for a conceptually different claim about session time) with zero citation anywhere. Let me check for any underlying benchmark data before concluding there's genuinely nothing behind it.

Confirmed — nothing. Zero benchmark files, zero dataset files, zero mention of "study," "benchmark," "citation," or "whitepaper" anywhere in the repo. Now the real Factory AI research.

This surfaces something that complicates the simple framing — worth checking one more angle before writing anything.

This complicates the framing I was handed, and I should report that honestly rather than confirm it uncritically. Factory's own announcement discloses **no empirical validation that higher Agent Readiness scores predict better agent outcomes** — the one number they publish (variance dropping from 7% to 0.6%) is about scoring *reproducibility*, not efficacy. And neither Agent Readiness nor Droid has any accountability/sign-off ledger at all — that whole category of problem isn't something Factory attempts. I have enough now for a real, sourced comparison. Writing both pieces.

Now updating the MOC to include the new note and reflect the corrected Competitive Positioning.

All confirmed, all written, all cross-linked cleanly (`unresolvedLinks: []` across every note). Stopping before GitHub issues, as always.

## The npm finding holds up, fully

Verified two independent ways: `npm view adx` shows a real package (`adx@0.0.0`, maintainer `youlingred`, created 2019-05-28 — seven years before Ahnaf's project existed) and an actual `npm install` in a clean, isolated directory (not the sandbox, not the throwaway repo) pulled down that exact package — no `index.js` in the tarball, no `.bin` entry, so even the installed result has no working `adx` command afterward. Checked whether this was a scoping mistake: it wasn't. All 8 packages use unscoped names, `adx-cli/package.json`'s real name is the bare `"adx"`, and `.changeset/config.json`'s release-versioning group is built around that same string — the intent was always the unscoped name. That makes this worse than a docs bug: npm won't let you publish over someone else's existing unscoped name, so **the package can't be published as currently configured, independent of what the docs say.**

## The two smaller checks both turned up real findings

No `LICENSE` file anywhere, and — sharper than I expected — no package.json across all 8 packages even declares a `license` field. And the abstraction.ts claim ("7–8% fewer tokens, 34% fewer file revisits") has zero citation anywhere — no benchmark file, no dataset, no mention of "study" or "whitepaper" in the whole repo or docs site.

## The Factory AI research came back more nuanced than the framing I was handed

I did the research this time and it partially corrects the premise rather than confirming it: Factory's Agent Readiness (9 pillars, 5 maturity levels, 100+ signals) is a more granular measurement tool than adx's four vitals, but **Factory has no accountability/sign-off ledger anywhere in its product line** — checked both Agent Readiness and Droid code-review directly. It's not that Factory does adx's Agency Ladder better; it doesn't attempt that problem at all. And Factory's own published methodology has the same kind of gap found in adx: the only empirical number they disclose is about scoring *reproducibility* (7%→0.6% variance), not evidence that higher scores predict better agent outcomes. I wrote this up as the correction it is, not a clean confirmation — telling Ahnaf "Factory validates and you don't" would have been wrong and checkable-as-wrong in ten minutes.

## Written

**Distribution and Adoption Gaps** (new note, cross-linked into the MOC and flagged as the one to read first) covers all three threads. **Competitive Positioning** was rewritten in place with the real, sourced findings — the note says explicitly what it's correcting from its own earlier version. The MOC's headline callout now leads with the npm finding, per your framing that it outranks everything found so far.

**Tool calls:**

packages/adx-gate/README.md:23:**Why it matters:** Agents produce boilerplate and abstraction layers at the same speed as functional code. They'll introduce an `interface UserRepository` with five methods, a `type UserMapper`, and an `interface UserDto` to solve a problem that needed two functions. These abstractions are syntactically valid, pass all tests, and cost nothing at commit time — but they accumulate. A codebase full of unused intermediate abstractions costs 7–8% more tokens per agent session to navigate, and causes 34% more file revisits during the investigation phase.
packages/adx-shape/README.md:15:**High revisit ratio:** If a file imports from A, which imports from B, which imports back from A (a cycle), the agent gets pulled into a loop reading the same files repeatedly. On projects with tight coupling, agents spend 34% of their session re-reading files they've already seen.

This note checks the layer before that: can a new user actually get adx onto their machine by following the docs, and would a team doing real due diligence stop before they even try. Both checks came from a lead flagged mid-review, verified independently here, not taken on report.\n## Key Claims\n- **The npm package name `adx` is already taken by an unrelated party.** `npm install -g adx` — literally the first command in the getting-started docs — installs a different, dead package, silently, with no error.\n- **This isn't a docs typo for a correctly-scoped name.** Every package in the monorepo uses the bare, unscoped name (`adx-cli/package.json`'s real `name` is `\"adx\"`); `.changeset/config.json` links release versioning around that same bare name. The intent was always the unscoped name.\n- **The package is currently unpublishable to npm as configured**, independent of the docs — npm doesn't allow publishing over an existing unscoped name under a different owner.\n- **No LICENSE file exists anywhere in the repository**, and no package.json across all 8 packages declares a `license` field either.\n- **adx's own \"7–8% fewer tokens, 34% fewer file revisits\" claim has no citation anywhere** — not in the repo, not on the docs site, not as a linked study.\n## Full Content\n### `npm install -g adx` installs the wrong package, with zero error\n==Verified two independent ways: `npm view adx` against the real registry, and an actual `npm install` in a clean directory — both confirm a real, unrelated, essentially-empty package with no functioning CLI at all.==\n```\n$ npm view adx\nadx@0.0.0 | MIT | deps: none | versions: 1\nmaintainers: youlingred <30897863@qq.com>\npublished over a year ago\ncreated: 2019-05-28\n```\nInstalled fresh in an isolated directory (not the sandbox clone, not the throwaway repo):\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"adx\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"author\": \"xiehui <30897863@qq.com>\",\n  \"license\": \"MIT\"\n}\n```\nNo `index.js` file actually shipped in the tarball — `find` on the installed package returned only `package.json`. No `.bin` entry was created. This package predates Ahnaf's project by seven years and has nothing to do with it. A user who runs the exact first command on `ahnafyy.github.io/adx/getting-started/` gets a silent, successful install of an empty package with no `adx` command afterward — not an error, not a wrong-version warning, nothing that would tell them something's off.\n### This was never a scoping mistake — the bare name was always the intent\n==Every one of the 8 packages uses an unscoped name; the changeset release config groups them by that same bare `\"adx\"` string. This is a genuine collision, not a docs command that forgot a `@scope/`.==\n```\npackages/adx-cli/package.json:      \"name\": \"adx\",\npackages/adx-sweep/package.json:    \"name\": \"adx-sweep\",\npackages/adx-vscode/package.json:   \"name\": \"adx-vscode\",\n... (all 8 packages, all unscoped)\n```\n`.changeset/config.json`: `\"linked\": [[\"adx\", \"adx-core\", \"adx-shape\", \"adx-gate\", \"adx-sweep\", \"adx-maintain\"]]` — the release-versioning group is built around the literal string `\"adx\"`. No `publishConfig` field anywhere in any package.json, no `.npmrc`, no registry override in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Nothing in the repository suggests a scoped name (`@ahnafyy/adx` or similar) was ever the plan.\n\nThis makes it worse than a documentation bug: even if `getting-started.md` were rewritten today with the correct install command, there isn't a correct command to write, because **`npm publish` on the current package as configured will fail outright** — npm requires unscoped package names to be globally unique, and this one belongs to someone else. The only real fixes are renaming the package (to a scoped name, e.g. `@ahnafyy/adx`) or acquiring the existing name from its current maintainer. Both are bigger changes than a docs edit.\n### No LICENSE — not the file, not even the metadata field\n==Checked both: no `LICENSE` file at the repository root, and no `package.json` across all 8 packages declares a `license` field at all.==\n```\n$ ls | grep -i licen\n(no output)\n$ grep -H '\"license\"' packages/*/package.json\n(no output)\n```\nThe unrelated squatted npm package at least declares `\"license\": \"MIT\"` in its metadata — Ahnaf's own packages don't, anywhere. For a team doing real adoption due diligence on a dependency, an npm registry page (if this were ever published) showing \"License: not specified\" is itself a stop-and-ask-legal moment, separate from and prior to any question about whether the tool works.\n### The tool's own precision claim has no source\n==`abstraction.ts`'s comment states specific numbers — \"7–8% fewer tokens,\" \"34% fewer file revisits\" — as empirical fact. No benchmark file, dataset, citation, or methodology note exists anywhere in the repository or docs site.==\n```\n// Empirically, clean code with a high signal-to-noise ratio costs 7–8% fewer\n// tokens for agents to process and requires 34% fewer file revisits during\n// investigation.\n```\nThe same numbers get restated as flat claims in two separate `README.md` files (`adx-gate/README.md` and `adx-shape/README.md`) — and in the second one, \"34%\" is repurposed for a conceptually different claim (\"agents spend 34% of their session re-reading files they've already seen\") rather than the file-revisit-count framing used everywhere else. Searched the full repo and docs site for any benchmark file, dataset, results directory, or the words \"study\"/\"whitepaper\"/\"benchmark\"/\"citation\" anywhere near these numbers: nothing. See [[Competitive Positioning]] for how this compares to Factory AI's own published methodology, which turned out to have a real but different gap.\n## Why It Matters\nEvery other note in this folder assumes a reader already has adx installed and running. This is the layer before that, and it's currently broken in a way the other findings aren't: silent, not loud. A crashing `init` command at least tells you something's wrong. A wrong package installing cleanly under the right name doesn't — a new user just gets confused later, with no error message pointing back here.\n## Links Into The Vault\n- [[Codebase Deep Read]] — index for this whole pass\n- [[Competitive Positioning]] — the citation-gap finding here has a direct, sourced parallel in how Factory AI's own scoring methodology turned out to be disclosed\n- [[Source Claims]] — captured the getting-started page's exact install sequence (`npm install -g adx && adx init` etc.) this note checks the first step of\n- [[Recommended Fixes]] — none of its existing items cover distribution; this is new ground\n## Open Questions\n- [ ] Is renaming to a scoped package (`@ahnafyy/adx`) or negotiating for the existing name the right call? Scoped names are free and immediate; acquiring an inactive name from its owner is unpredictable and can take a long time.\n- [ ] Does Ahnaf know the package has never actually been published to npm under any name — or was this assumed working because `npm install -g adx` \"looks like\" a normal, working instruction?\n"}`

And its own published methodology has the same undisclosed-validation gap this review found in adx's abstraction.ts.==\n## What This Note Corrects From Its Own Prior Version\nThe earlier version of this note recorded a scoping decision without research behind it, by design — flagged honestly at the time. This version replaces that with real, independently sourced findings. Two things from the original framing didn't survive contact with actual research, and are corrected below rather than quietly dropped.\n## Key Claims\n- **Factory's Agent Readiness measures codebase quality across 9 pillars and 5 maturity levels** (Style & Validation, Build System, Testing, Documentation, Dev Environment, Debugging & Observability, Security, Task Discovery, Product & Experimentation) — more granular and more explicitly structured than adx's four vitals (TDS/FRR/BER/HDI).\n- **Factory has no accountability, sign-off, or audit-ledger mechanism anywhere in its product line** — checked both Agent Readiness and the Droid code-review product directly. This is the correction to the framing: Factory isn't \"better\" at the thing adx's Agency Ladder does. It doesn't attempt that problem at all.\n- **Factory's own published methodology has an undisclosed-validation gap that closely parallels adx's uncited 7–8%/34% claim** — the only empirical number Factory discloses (variance dropping from 7% to 0.6% across 9 benchmark repos) is about scoring *reproducibility*, not whether higher scores predict better agent outcomes. Neither company publishes evidence that its scoring criteria causally improve agent performance.\n- **Factory's Droid product does have a real, working permission model** — \"autonomy levels\" from fully-supervised to full-autonomy, gating what the agent can do before it acts. This is a genuinely different mechanism from adx's Agency Ladder: a runtime permission gate (what you're allowed to do) versus a retrospective accountability record (what level of human understanding was certified after the fact). Worth being precise about this distinction with Ahnaf — they solve adjacent but different problems.\n## Full Content\n### The comparison that holds up\n==adx bundles measurement and governance into one tool; Factory keeps them separate and doesn't claim to solve governance at all — and the governance half of adx's bundle is the half proven non-functional in [[Safety-Critical Gaps]].==\nThis is the sharper, defensible version of \"adx's real differentiator is currently faked\": it's not that a competitor does accountability better. It's that adx claims to do *both* measurement and accountability, and only the measurement half has any live competitor doing it more rigorously (Factory's 9-pillar, 100+-signal Agent Readiness vs. adx's four vitals) — while the accountability half, which no other tool in this space appears to attempt, is the part [[Safety-Critical Gaps]] shows doesn't actually require human input in CI, hardcodes `signedBy: 'engineer'`, and is unaffected by every config variation tested.\n### The comparison that doesn't hold up as stated\n==Factory does not have a working accountability ledger to point to as superior — it simply doesn't compete in that category, on either of its two relevant products.==\nChecked directly: Factory's Agent Readiness docs describe no approval workflow, sign-off tracking, or historical ledger — \"purely diagnostic rather than governance-oriented.\" Factory's Droid code-review docs describe an operational review flow (inline comments, an approval action) with no persistent audit mechanism of its own; any record that exists is incidental to GitHub's native PR history, not a designed feature. Neither product has anything resembling adx's `.adx/state/adx-agency.json` ledger or the Agency Ladder's 7-level scale. This means the original framing — \"Factory validates against real telemetry, adx doesn't\" — needs a real correction, not just softening: Factory's own announcement discloses no study, dataset, or telemetry linking its readiness scores to actual agent-success outcomes. The one number it publishes is about scoring consistency across repeated runs, not efficacy. Both companies assert that their scoring criteria matter; neither publishes evidence that they do.\n### Sources\n- [Agent Readiness Overview — Factory Documentation](https://docs.factory.ai/web/agent-readiness/overview) — the 9 pillars, 5 maturity levels, 80%-of-previous-level gating rule\n- [Introducing Agent Readiness — Factory.ai](https://factory.ai/news/agent-readiness) — the only disclosed empirical number (7%→0.6% variance across 9 benchmark repos), and the absence of outcome-validation data\n- [Automated Code Review — Factory Documentation](https://docs.factory.ai/guides/droid-exec/code-review) — Droid's review flow, no persistent audit mechanism described\n- Factory AI multi-agent platform reviews (secondary, for the autonomy-levels/permission-model description): [Factory AI Platform Review](https://www.digitalapplied.com/blog/factory-ai-multi-agent-coding-platform-review)\n## Why It Matters\nThis is close to being the sharpest available comparison for the mentor conversation, and it's sharper *with* the correction than the original framing was without it: telling Ahnaf \"Factory validates its numbers and you don't\" would be wrong and checkable-as-wrong in about ten minutes. Telling him \"no one in this space — including Factory — publishes evidence that their scoring predicts real agent outcomes, and your specific abstraction-overhead numbers are exactly as uncited as theirs, but your Agency Ladder is trying to solve a problem Factory doesn't even attempt\" is accurate, sourced, and more useful to him.\n## Links Into The Vault\n- [[Codebase Deep Read]] — index for this whole pass\n- [[Safety-Critical Gaps]] — the evidence behind \"the accountability half doesn't work\"\n- [[Distribution and Adoption Gaps]] — the direct parallel: adx's own uncited quantitative claim, checked the same way Factory's was here\n- [[adx]] — its \"Competitive Read\" section currently doesn't mention Factory AI or CodeScene at all; this note is the candidate content for adding Factory\n## Open Questions\n- [ ] Should [[adx]]'s Competitive Read section be updated with this now, or held until after the mentor conversation in case the framing changes based on what Ahnaf says?\n- [ ] Is the permission-gate vs. accountability-ledger distinction (Droid's autonomy levels vs. adx's Agency Ladder) worth its own follow-up — they're different enough mechanisms that \"adx's ladder is better\" isn't automatically true just because Factory doesn't have one.\n"}`

No issues open until that gets a separate go-ahead.\n---\n# adx — Codebase Deep Read (MOC)\n==Nobody can currently install this tool by following its own docs — `npm install -g adx` silently installs an unrelated, dead package from 2019 — and everything else in this folder describes what happens once you get past that, using a build from source instead.==\n## Goal\nGet past \"the code matches the docs, or it doesn't\" into \"here's what actually happens when this runs, proven by running it\" — before any of it becomes a GitHub issue or a document for Ahnaf. This folder is the second code-level pass, two weeks after [[Claims vs Implementation]] and one month after the repository itself last changed.\n## What This Pass Covered That the Original Didn't\nThe July review read every non-test `.ts` file across all 8 packages. This pass:\n- Read the test files themselves, the CLI command wrappers, the harness's supporting modules, `adx-vscode`'s webview content, and `adx-intellij` — a Kotlin IntelliJ plugin that existed in the repository the whole time but was never mentioned in the original four notes or, as it turns out, anywhere in adx's own README or docs site.\n- Built the CLI from source and ran it directly against a disposable throwaway repo (`~/projects/ai/claude/adx-worktree-throwaway-test/`, kept on disk, not deleted) — `init`, `run --exec`, `gate --ci`, `maintain`, `sweep`, across multiple flag and config combinations.\n- Started the MCP server for real and called all 6 tools through an actual client, not just read the handler code.\n- Read every substantive commit's diff, not just the current file state — this is how the `adx init` crash got traced to its exact origin, and how the BER-score-jump commit's real mechanism got found.\n- Checked the layer before all of that: whether a new user can actually get the tool onto their machine, and whether the license/citation surface would survive real due diligence.\n- Confirmed, via `gh api` and `git fetch origin`, that nothing has changed in the real repository since 2026-07-07 — a month of dormancy, not ongoing development.\n## Corrections to the Existing Notes\n- **[[Claims vs Implementation]]**'s \"Repository Reality Check\" section states *\"`git log --oneline` returns exactly one commit\"*. This was a shallow-clone (`--depth 1`) artifact — the real history is 17 commits across a single 3-hour window on 2026-07-06/07. Confirmed directly: nothing was rewritten or force-pushed; the original clone simply never fetched full history. Nothing else in that note changes — the code state it reviewed and the code state reviewed here are identical. Flagged here for a deliberate edit to that note later, not changed in place — see [[Process and CI Gaps]] for the full detail.\n## The Five New Notes\n- [[Distribution and Adoption Gaps]] — **read this one first.** The npm package name `adx` is already taken by an unrelated, essentially-empty package from 2019; the getting-started docs' first command silently installs the wrong thing. No LICENSE file, no `license` field in any package.json. Adoption-funnel problems, not code bugs — nobody can reach the code the way the docs describe at all.\n- [[Safety-Critical Gaps]] — the harness's isolation, verification, and governance mechanisms, tested against the exact conditions (unattended runs, interrupted processes, CI with no human watching) they're built for. Packages: `adx-core`, `adx-gate`, `adx-maintain`.\n- [[Process and CI Gaps]] — why the worst code bug found this pass shipped and survived: TypeScript catches it instantly, and nothing in this project's pipeline ever asks TypeScript. Also: a stale self-reported score, and a live-reproduced metric divergence. Packages: `adx-cli`, `adx-core`, `adx-gate`, the root tooling.\n- [[Dead-on-Arrival Code]] — commands, config fields, and a whole package (`adx-intellij`) that exist but don't do what they claim, organized by failure shape. Packages: `adx-cli`, `adx-core`, `adx-mcp`, `adx-intellij`, `adx-shape`, `adx-sweep`, `adx-vscode`.\n- [[Competitive Positioning]] — real, sourced Factory AI research, done after an earlier version of this note correctly flagged itself as unresearched. The comparison is sharper than the version it replaces, and one part of the original framing didn't survive verification — corrected in place, not quietly dropped.\n## The Single Best Insight From This Pass\nadx's actual claim to novelty — per [[adx]]'s own Competitive Read — is the three-pillar bundle, and the idea doing the real conceptual work inside it is the Agency Ladder: forcing genuine human accountability instead of rubber-stamping. [[Safety-Critical Gaps]] shows that mechanism is exactly the one currently faked — CI auto-approves Level 6 with a hardcoded `signedBy: 'engineer'`, unaffected by any config. [[Competitive Positioning]] found the sharper version of this point: Factory AI doesn't do accountability better than adx — it doesn't attempt accountability at all, on any of its products. adx is trying to solve a harder, more valuable problem than its nearest competitor even attempts, and the part of adx that tries to solve it doesn't work yet.\n## Methodology\nEvery finding in these five notes is one of four things, and each note says which: read directly in source, reproduced by running the built CLI or MCP server against a throwaway repo, traced through `git show`/`git log` on the actual commit that introduced or broke it, or independently verified against a live external source (npm registry, Factory AI's own docs) rather than taken on report. Nothing here is a single observation standing alone — claims that started as one observation were deliberately re-tested across flag combinations, config variations, repeated runs, or independent sources before being written down.\n## Open Questions\n- [ ] Which of these findings does Ahnaf already know about? The mentorship framing (per [[Mentor Details]] and the original meeting transcript) is that he wants the harsh read specifically because he can't get it from his own team — worth checking directly rather than assuming any of this is news.\n- [ ] Does the npm name collision change the order of operations for raising anything with him — it's arguably more urgent than the `adx init` crash, since it blocks a first-time user one step earlier and with zero error signal.\n- [ ] See each individual note's Open Questions for narrower follow-ups.\n## Next Action\nDecide what becomes a GitHub issue, and how the issue set is split (concrete bug-fix issues, the one Factory-positioning issue already scoped, and now potentially a distribution/naming issue). Per standing instruction, no issues get opened until that decision gets a separate go-ahead.\n## Log\n- **2026-08-07:** Read every file the July pass hadn't (tests, CLI wrappers, harness internals, `adx-vscode` webview, `adx-intellij`); built and ran the CLI against a throwaway repo; found and root-caused the `adx init` crash; found the `--exec` worktree bypass and proved it with a live file-write probe; found and reproduced mutation-testing crash-corruption; started the MCP server for real and called all 6 tools, surfacing a live BER divergence and a third JSON-schema shape; confirmed via `gh api` that the real repository has had zero commits since 2026-07-07; wrote this note plus [[Safety-Critical Gaps]], [[Process and CI Gaps]], [[Dead-on-Arrival Code]], and a first, deliberately unresearched version of [[Competitive Positioning]].\n- **2026-08-07 (same day, second pass):** Verified the npm package-name collision independently (registry query + real clean install); confirmed no LICENSE file or license metadata anywhere; confirmed adx's 7–8%/34% claim has zero citation; wrote [[Distribution and Adoption Gaps]]. Did the real Factory AI research owed from the first pass — found the accountability-comparison framing was directionally right but needed a real correction (Factory doesn't out-perform adx's Agency Ladder, it doesn't attempt that problem at all), and found Factory's own published methodology has an undisclosed-validation gap paralleling adx's uncited numbers. Rewrote [[Competitive Positioning]] in place with sourced findings.\n"}`

## You

What I fixed directly

- adx.md's next: field had a broken wikilink left over from before the four notes were renamed — corrected.
- adx.md had zero awareness that Codebase Deep Read exists — added it to related_progress, and added a pointer in "Verification Against The Codebase" noting the deeper pass supersedes parts of it (led with the npm finding, since it's the single most important thing that note was missing).
- Recommended Fixes.md is frozen at 2026-07-22 with no knowledge of the five Codebase\ notes — added an explicit [!WARNING] banner so nobody mistakes it for current, rather than letting a stale "source of truth" note look authoritative.
- Mentor Meeting Transcript.md had entirely empty frontmatter (input_kind, status, created, next all blank) even after being moved into Transcripts/ — filled in against the new For Transcript.md template.

What still needs a real pass (not fixed — flagged for the next session)

1. Recommended Fixes.md needs an actual rewrite, not just a warning banner — folding in the npm-squatting finding (new #1 priority), the hardened safety findings, the LICENSE gap, and everything else Codebase\ found that the original static-reading pass couldn't have known.
2. Project Briefings - 2026-07-13.md doesn't match the Brief Standard it's cited as the gold example of — needs either a real reformat (ideally by actually running /transcript-to-brief against the real transcript now that the skill exists) or the Standard's citation softened to acknowledge it's aspirational, not yet true.
3. adx.md and Codebase Deep Read.md are both type: project while functioning as MOCs, and the vault now has a real type: index / MOC Standard. I did not convert them — MOC Standard's Purpose→Map→Status→Dataview→Links shape has no room for the substantive analysis these two notes carry (Competitive Read, Problem Statement, methodology), so forcing conformance would mean deciding where that content goes, not just changing a frontmatter field. That's a real call, not something to make unilaterally on a note this much other work already links into.

This is the last note-refinement pass before everything in Mentorship Program\
gets treated as ready — no more open-ended digging after this. Two things
happened since your last report: I read every note in Mentorship Program\
(not just adx\), against the vault's new MOC/Brief/Action infrastructure, and
made the safe fixes myself. Here's what's still yours to close.

## Already fixed, for your awareness — don't redo these
- adx.md's next: field had a broken wikilink from before the rename; fixed.
- adx.md now links forward to Codebase Deep Read and flags that its
  "Verification Against The Codebase" section is the shallower of two passes.
- Recommended Fixes.md now has a [!WARNING] banner stating it predates
  Codebase\ and is incomplete, not just unranked.
- Mentor Meeting Transcript.md's frontmatter was entirely empty (input_kind,
  status, created, next all blank) even after moving into Transcripts\ —
  filled in against 30_Order/Templates/Frontmatter/For Transcript.md.

## The real work: rewrite Recommended Fixes.md
This is the single highest-value thing left. Read all five Codebase\ notes
plus the current Recommended Fixes.md, then rewrite it for real — not append
to it. New priority order needs to lead with the npm package-name collision
(Distribution and Adoption Gaps) — it blocks every single item currently on
the list, since none of them matter if nobody can install the tool in the
first place. Fold in: the confirmed-unconditional adx init crash and its
exact root cause, the proven --exec worktree bypass, the reproduced
mutation-testing corruption, the CI auto-approve being config-independent
(not just a gap — verified across three config variations), no LICENSE
anywhere, the uncited 7-8%/34% claim, the live BER divergence, the stale
badge, and adx-intellij's dead Tools-menu actions. Cross-check the old list's
existing items too — several were confirmed and hardened, not just repeated;
say which ones got stronger evidence and which stayed as originally stated.

## A real decision, not a quick fix: Project Briefings - 2026-07-13.md
Brief Standard.md cites this note as its own Gold Standard Example, and
Mentorship Board.md calls it "the current real example" of the
transcript-to-brief workflow. It isn't, structurally — it predates the
Standard, uses type: project, and doesn't have the prescribed frontmatter
(input_kind: transcript, source_note:) or headings (What Was Decided, Key
Threads, Open Questions, Follow-Up Actions). Two real options, not a
default: (a) actually run /transcript-to-brief against
Meetings/Transcripts/Mentor Meeting Transcript.md now that the skill exists,
producing a real conforming brief and deciding what happens to the old note,
or (b) leave the existing note as-is and soften Brief Standard's citation to
say so honestly instead of claiming conformance that isn't there. Pick one,
don't leave it unresolved.

## One judgment call already made for you, worth knowing
adx.md and Codebase Deep Read.md stay type: project, not type: index — MOC
Standard's Purpose/Map/Status/Dataview/Links shape has no room for the
substantive product analysis (Competitive Read, Problem Statement,
methodology) these two notes carry, and forcing them into it would mean
deciding where that content goes, which is bigger than a frontmatter change.
Don't revisit this unless you find a real reason to.

## Then: one final sweep of the whole folder, not just adx\
Read every note under Mentorship Program\ end to end — Mentor Details.md,
both files under Plans\, Mentorship Board.md, everything under Meetings\
(including the two superseded files), and the full adx\ + Codebase\ set.
Check specifically for: broken wikilinks (grep for stale "adx — " prefixes
again after your edits, and check Meetings\'s new subfolder structure hasn't
orphaned anything), frontmatter that doesn't match its type's Standard,
dates that don't add up, and any note claiming something another note now
contradicts. This is the actual bar for "source of truth" — not that each
note is individually well-written, but that nothing in the folder disagrees
with anything else in it.

## Still not creating anything downstream
No Word document, no GitHub issues, no PR. Report back when the rewrite, the
brief decision, and the final sweep are all done — that's the real endpoint
of this whole note-writing thread.

## Claude

Noting something for the sweep already: there's a scattered set of `.tmp.35820.<hash>` files (`Mentorship Board.md.tmp...`, `Brief Standard.md.tmp...`, `MOC Standard.md.tmp...`, `For Transcript.md.tmp...`, `Fall 2026 — Detailed Expectations.md.tmp...`, `Plan.md.tmp...`) — all sharing the same process ID, likely an interrupted editor/sync write. Checking whether they diverge from their real counterparts before flagging this properly. Reading the new infrastructure now.

Found something the user's own fix report didn't catch: **`Mentor Meeting Transcript.md`'s frontmatter is still completely empty** — `input_kind: null, status: null, created: null, source_url: null` — despite being reported as fixed. I'll correct that for real. Also confirmed precisely: `Project Briefings - 2026-07-13.md` doesn't conform to Brief Standard at all — wrong `type`, wrong field names (`related` vs `related_progress`), no `source_note`, and its five numbered action-plan sections don't match the prescribed What Was Decided/Key Threads/Open Questions/Follow-Up Actions shape. Reading the rest of the folder now before deciding what to do about it.

Fixing Plan.md's broken wikilink now — the real note is `Learning Tracker tool.md`, filed under `Arc/`, not literally named "Arc (Learning Tracker)".

That patch went in wrong — I passed the array as a string instead of structured JSON, corrupting the YAML. Fixing both properly now.

Good, that's clean now. Fixing `Mentor Meeting Transcript.md`'s empty frontmatter the same way — writing directly rather than patching, given the bug I just hit.

The `related_progress` and `tags` patches show the same corruption on closer inspection — the full-file read reveals they're stored as quoted JSON strings, not real YAML arrays (a targeted frontmatter-field read apparently normalizes it back on the way out, which is what fooled my earlier check). Fixing with a full rewrite, keeping the transcript content verbatim.

Let me check if an Action Standard exists before creating the action note, so it matches whatever shape is prescribed.

Confirmed: `Action Standard.md` doesn't exist yet — Brief Standard references it, but it was never written. I won't invent a Standard to claim conformance to; that would repeat the exact problem I'm fixing. Cleanest honest path: write a real, Brief-Standard-conforming Brief (that Standard is fully real), and relocate the existing detailed action content to `Meetings/Action/` as what it honestly is — a real action note — without claiming it conforms to a Standard that isn't written yet.

Now the big one — rewriting Recommended Fixes.md for real.

Found a real dating inconsistency in my own work — a date-change reminder fired mid-session and I kept using the old date (2026-08-07) across three notes that were actually written today (2026-08-08): `Distribution and Adoption Gaps.md`, the `Competitive Positioning.md` rewrite, and the MOC's second log entry. Fixing all three now.

## All four pieces are done. Summary:

**Rewrote Recommended Fixes.md for real** — led with the npm collision (Section 0, blocks everything else), then every item from the original list cross-checked and marked explicitly: **hardened** (signer identity, CI auto-approve, BER divergence, `router`, `enforceTasteCheck`, `requireExplanationInvariants`, `adx ratchet`, MCP Layer-1, frozen-path matching — all now have live proof instead of a single reading), **unchanged** (things this pass didn't re-test, said so plainly), or **new** (the `--exec` worktree bypass, mutation-corruption, `maintain override`, the whole CI/typecheck root-cause chain, the `adx init` crash, `adx-intellij`, `maxRetries`, `fileExists`/`bar()` duplication, `.tsx` resolution, the sweep scoring bug, LICENSE, the citation gap).

**Decided the Brief question — went with (a), for real.** No `/transcript-to-brief` skill exists in this environment and no `Action Standard` exists yet to conform to (checked — Brief Standard cites it but it was never written), so I didn't invent one. Instead: wrote a genuine Brief-Standard-conforming note at the same canonical path, and moved the detailed content — as itself, not dressed up as something it isn't — to a new `2026-07-14 Mentor Meeting — Actions.md`. Both Brief Standard's and Mentorship Board's citations of this note are now actually true, not just aspirationally true.

**Full-folder sweep turned up real problems, including in my own prior work:**
- `Mentor Meeting Transcript.md`'s frontmatter was still completely empty — the earlier fix claim hadn't actually saved. Fixed now, verified via full-content read (a targeted field read was masking a real storage bug — more below).
- `Plan.md` had a genuinely broken wikilink (`[[Arc (Learning Tracker)]]` — the real note is `Learning Tracker tool.md`). Fixed.
- **Found a real bug in `vault_patch`**: writing array-valued frontmatter through it silently corrupts the YAML into a quoted JSON string instead of a real list — and a *targeted* frontmatter-field read doesn't reveal this (it re-normalizes on the way out), only a full-content read does. Worth knowing for any future edits — I switched to `vault_write` for anything array-valued after finding this.
- **Found my own dating error**: a date-change reminder fired mid-session and I kept writing "2026-08-07" across three notes actually written today. Fixed `Distribution and Adoption Gaps.md`, `Competitive Positioning.md`, and the MOC's log.
- **Not fixed, flagged for you**: `Mentor Details.md` carries a `deadline: 2025-09-30` — over a year stale, clearly leftover intake-form cruft, but I don't know if it still means something to you, so I reported rather than silently changed it. Also: a scattered set of `.tmp.35820.*` ghost files (Mentorship Board, Brief Standard, MOC Standard, For Transcript, Fall 2026 doc, Plan) sitting alongside their real counterparts — look like an interrupted editor/sync write, all sharing one process ID. I didn't touch them; not mine to clean up without knowing if they're recoverable data or pure debris.

Nothing opened on GitHub. Ready when you are to talk about issues.

This program will match you with an industry professional in your area of interest. \n- You will take the lead in the relationship by identifying your goals for the program and by being in contact with your mentor via face-to-face, telephone, or email communications at least two times per month.\n- Your mentor may provide you with career advice, guidance, and networking opportunities, however, they are not expected to provide students with jobs or internships.\n\n[# CSE Mentor Program How to Guide for Students](https://cse.umn.edu/college/alumni/mentor-program-how-to-guide-students?j=13644821&sfmc_sub=621816736&l=591_HTML&u=278673031&mid=6325307&jb=2#reachout) - Link\n[# CSE Mentor Program materials and information](https://cse.umn.edu/college/alumni/cse-mentor-program-materials-and-information?j=13644821&sfmc_sub=621816736&l=591_HTML&u=278673035&mid=6325307&jb=2) - Link\n[Mentorship Guideline](https://cse.umn.edu/college/cse-mentor-program-guidelines) - Link\n## Goals\nGoogle doc link - [Detailed Goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/[REDACTED]/edit?usp=sharing)\n**UMN Break Guide**: ![[Making Break Meaningful 1.pdf]]\n## Things to talk about\n- Search for openings on [Handshake](https://handshake.umn.edu/) by interest or major and read through the job descriptions. Together, consider if the job duties and company fit your personality, skills, values, and interests. Try the same thing on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com) or an industry job board.\n- Make a plan for the summer to explore careers in your major.\n- Discuss what is the most important thing a new employee can do to set themselves up for success.\n- Discuss how to maintain productivity and accountability working remotely.\n- Talk about how to identify professional development opportunities in the workplace and how to continue growing and learning once you're out of college.\n- Discuss how to approach social media at work. Mentors, share the norms and expectations at your workplace and discuss how those expectations are different from college.\n- What types of goals do they wish they had focused on? What types of goals do they have now?\n- CSE Career services: Schedule an appointment?\n### Winter\n- Practice their elevator pitch with them and discuss how to approach or talk to recruiters.\n\t- Short sweet, describes what you do.\n- The MoSCoW framework is a simple yet powerful prioritization technique in project management and business analysis, using an acronym for **M**ust-have, **S**hould-have, **C**ould-have, and **W**on't-have (this time) to classify requirements and features, ensuring stakeholder alignment on what's crucial for a successful delivery, especially in time-boxed projects like [Agile sprints](https://www.google.com/search?q=Agile+sprints&oq=mosco+fr&gs_lcrp=[REDACTED]&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&ved=[REDACTED]). It creates a shared understanding of priorities, focusing teams on essential features first (Must-haves) while managing expectations for desirable but non-critical items (Could-haves) and deferred items (Won't-haves). \n- *Projects*: \n\t- [[Portfolio]]: Chatbot and moving carousels. \n\t- [[Learning Tracker tool|Arc (Learning Tracker)]]: \n- *Internship*: \n\t- Resources for applying to internships\n\t- Courses that i should be working on right now - help me with my project\n\t- Reach out to managers on portals based on my experience and their experience.\n\t- Mock interviews: 2 mock interviews by February end\n- *Start up*: **learn the playbook—no launch**. Do these tiny exercises over the 4 weeks (1–2h each):\n\t1. **Problem Thesis (Learning Tracker)**: Who (students tracking goals), what pain (inconsistent habits, no feedback), alternatives (notes/app chaos), _why now_ (intern recruiting pressure). Add 5 quotes from friends.\n\t2. What does the product do? who does it help?\n\t3. **Figma click-through** of one flow (CheckIn → progress update).\n\t4. **MVP cutlist**: Must-have = create goal, weekly check-in, chart trend.\n\t\t- Non-goals (for now) = teams, notifications, multi-device sync.\n\t5. Reach out to employeers for project based learning. \n\t6. **Validation plan** (thought experiment): Success metric for a pilot: 10 weekly active users with ≥2 check-ins/week; if not, what would you change?\n\t**What to ask Ahnaf each time**\n\t- \"Where would you cut scope more?\"\n\t- \"What metric would you watch first?\"\n\t- \"What early mistakes would you pre-empt?\"\n#### Plan\n1. **Standing items I'll bring each meeting**:\n\t- **Demo link + 3 screenshots**\n\t- **What I shipped / What blocked me / What I'm deciding next** (one slide).\n\t- **One Role Brief** (1 page) until you've covered: Frontend, Backend, Full-stack, DevOps, Data, Mobile.\n## Summer\nThis section covers only what earns a mentor's time: 4 focused goals, not the full execution grind. Daily/weekly work (LeetCode, courses, project builds) lives in [[Summer Grind]] and [[10_Areas/Life/Plans/Summer/00 - Summer Plans Index|the Summer Plans folder]] — Ahnaf never needs that layer, only the parts that need outside judgment. Full per-meeting scripts and the running log live in [[Mentor Meeting Playbook]].\n### The 4 Goals\nNot \"help with my whole summer\" — four specific things a mentor is actually useful for:\n1. **Relationship** — a connection with Ahnaf strong enough that he'd recommend me to other employers, and one that keeps going after the program's stated end around September 2026. Earned by demonstrating execution each meeting, not by asking directly — see [[Mentorship and Networking]] on why warm intros beat cold applications.\n2. **Project + build review** — professional feedback on the actual build setup, not demo praise. [[Portfolio]] is live at anantgupta.dev, with **Orby** (the AI agent behind it) as the real focus, not visual polish. [[Stocks Trading AI Hub|TradingView]] is framed as a personal quant side project, not a revenue play. [[CausalOps — Index|CausalOps]] has its memory layer implemented, pending a SQL migration. Concrete depth on all three: [[Project Briefings - 2026-07-13]].\n3. **Startup fundamentals** — no fixed idea yet. The ask is the real playbook: how a startup actually gets built and launched, and what the first concrete step looks like. Winter's version of this was \"learn the playbook, no launch\" ([[Plan#Winter|Winter]]); this is the next layer.\n4. **Professional image** — resume, interview prep, and online presence, feeding into the [[Internship - Dashboard|2027 internship pipeline]] (Wave 1 quant open now, Wave 2 big tech Jul–Oct 2026) and eventually into during-internship conduct once one lands.\n### Meeting Cadence\nStanding rhythm: **every other Monday**, 30 minutes, locked in starting the 2026-07-13 meeting. This replaces the ad-hoc few-times-a-month pattern with something both sides can hold to through the program's end and past it. If a real decision point comes up between meetings — a pivot, a deadline, a specific ask — add one short extra sync that week instead of waiting for the next standing slot.\n### Standing Meeting Format\nEvery meeting: **Demo → Shipped/Blocked/Deciding → Ask**, the same shape as the original program framework under [[Plan#Things to talk about|Things to talk about]]. Bring one updated artifact — a screenshot, a README line, or one honest sentence on what broke — and rotate through the 4 goals above so no single goal gets skipped for months at a time.\n### 5-Month Roadmap (July → December 2026)\n- **July:** ship weekly on the TradingView flagship, close out CausalOps' integration tests. Wave 1 quant applications are open now (HRT, Citadel Launch).\n- **August:** Bangalore buffer/consolidation — make Portfolio and CausalOps presentable. Wave 2 big-tech windows open (Google ASDI, Microsoft Explore, LinkedIn First Play). First mock interview.\n- **September:** program's stated end. Treat this as the relationship-transition month, not a goodbye — this is where goal 1 either holds or doesn't.\n- **October:** Wave 2 deadlines close. Resume and portfolio need to already be interview-ready, not \"getting there.\"\n- **November-December:** interview prep intensifies. Follow through on any warm intro Ahnaf makes, and report back what happened — that's what keeps a mentor relationship alive after the program ends.\n### Success Metrics\nBy the program's end, this should be true:\n- [ ] Ahnaf can describe one real technical decision from each of the 4 project areas, not just names.\n- [ ] At least one warm introduction or explicit offer to recommend, followed up and reported back on.\n- [ ] Startup playbook understood well enough to answer \"what's the first concrete step\" without hedging.\n- [ ] Resume and portfolio reviewed directly by Ahnaf at least once, with changes made, not just discussed.\n- [ ] Cadence held through September without either side letting it lapse.\n### Resources\n1. Informational Interviews - [Link](https://youtu.be/Of9w5eLNBwA?si=BFmcNow-6J2dY9XE) Youtube video.\n## Fall 2026\nCadence holds at alternate weeks, unchanged from [[Plan#Summer|Summer]]. Specifics are deliberately not pre-written here — [[Fall 2026 — Detailed Expectations]] accumulates what's actually required from Ahnaf as real meetings happen, via `/note-to-actions` against each meeting's brief, not from assumptions made now. Before any adx-specific work, the priority is establishing everything required from Ahnaf systematically, so nothing gets worked on out of order. A second mentor, for a different purpose, is a live idea for fall enrollment — future work, not yet built out.\n"}`

[1:21]: in india\nThem [1:23]: i'm in india i'm back home\nThem [1:32]: one can tell because i feel like just south asia has a feel to it\nThem [1:38]: reminds me of me being back home at my place in bangladesh\nThem [1:41]: yeah i've been to a mandir and all of that\nThem [1:44]: having\nThem [1:45]: a great time\nThem [1:45]: right now\nThem [1:52]: nice nice is it\nAnant [1:52]: really hot there because in minnesota the temperature is getting really bad\nAnant [1:54]: it is\nAnant [1:58]: well it's been rainy i live in bangalore\nAnant [2:03]: so i like the weather over here it's perfect weather it's great\nAnant [2:11]: nice so\nAnant [2:14]: i finally got my website deployed and this time\nAnant [2:21]: this time i did not do\nAnant [2:23]: anything\nAnant [2:48]: about this website\nAnant [2:49]: i'd say\nAnant [2:49]: this\nAnant [2:51]: tiny\nAnant [4:40]: and\nAnant [5:03]: just\nAnant [5:04]: a minute\nAnant [5:10]: as the\nAnant [5:16]: head of software for vercel\nAnant [5:22]: and was leading the vercel skills work the vercel ai sdk\nAnant [5:28]: great great i was going to join this hackathon\nAnant [5:30]: which is\nAnant [5:30]: working with\nAnant [5:30]: yourself\nThem [5:54]: the other things\nThem [5:54]: okay\nThem [5:56]: there's going to answer you\nThem [6:08]: i would like to propose to you is to master the art of evals eval says back in the days to have tests and deterministic tests where our only\nThem [6:30]: possible\nAnant [6:38]: mimicking is the answers that you're sending the guard release has been enforced\nAnant [6:38]: exactly\nAnant [6:47]: be like hey not any of email address was shared besides gupta 0749\nAnant [6:56]: at you you could go have it around latency so i would\nThem [7:02]: put workflows\nThem [7:02]: that\nThem [7:04]: will have a job in this universe\nThem [7:17]: in the age of coding everyone's a developer\nAnant [7:35]: yep agreed\nAnant [7:46]: i've been working on eval testing project that i've been doing it's called causal ops it's a cyber security related thing and i've got four to five people working on it\nAnant [7:50]: and there's the senior that i mean he really amazed me with this project so unlike i'll hop on it\nAnant [7:51]: and it's backed by mit\nAnant [7:56]: so which is crazy\nAnant [7:57]: it's not over here\nAnant [7:58]: it's not be even here\nAnant [8:11]: that's a mouthful\nAnant [8:20]: i like it you're writing emails is there as well to compose average treatment learn\nThem [8:20]: parent agents so what you're building out is i think you're doing\nThem [8:30]: to solve the context graph problem what you're actually trying to solve here is the orchestration problem and how to have less hallucination and things that are driven by\nAnant [8:32]: evidence rather than not\nAnant [8:34]: yep exactly\nAnant [8:38]: and for that i just\nAnant [8:40]: will be rich so what i work with is first to\nAnant [8:41]: the 10\nAnant [8:42]: semantic memory and retrieval\nAnant [8:47]: in that process we had like\nAnant [8:49]: not important meetings for this\nAnant [8:50]: and i\nAnant [8:51]: will be mcp bridge\nAnant [8:54]: so a lot of like we have like three agents running\nAnant [8:55]: on this right now\nAnant [8:58]: so how will these consistent memory\nAnant [9:02]: and the next step over here will be you build the drop that you were talking about\nAnant [9:04]: i\nAnant [9:06]: m not\nAnant [9:06]: giving that\nAnant [9:08]: deep into computer networks\nAnant [9:08]: to know about it\nAnant [9:12]: so that's going to be another\nAnant [9:12]: learning process\nAnant [9:13]: to mitig\nAnant [9:14]: ate\nAnant [9:16]: this project\nAnant [9:17]: and then working on\nAnant [9:18]: it for like two months now\nAnant [9:19]: it's going pretty well\nAnant [9:22]: it's taught me a lot of what cybersecurity\nAnant [9:25]: and i recently i got into\nAnant [9:26]: the development\nAnant [9:26]: so this was\nAnant [9:27]: my latest\nAnant [9:28]: task\nAnant [9:31]: pretty\nAnant [9:32]: four people\nAnant [9:33]: on this project\nAnant [9:34]: very far\nAnant [9:43]: i'm starting to hospital something else\nAnant [9:48]: because everyone just like riding code willingly and not actually validating stuff\nAnant [9:51]: we need to make the code\nAnant [9:52]: be a little bit better\nThem [9:59]: but how do you\nThem [10:02]: make a code based letter for ai to be able to iterate as much as possible\nAnant [10:05]: and\nThem [10:07]: i'm going to solve for the baby hangout package\nThem [10:10]: or an adjective development kit\nThem [10:12]: origin development experience\nThem [10:13]: kit\nThem [10:17]: i haven't pushed out the code here main library\nThem [10:18]: but i'm trying to get feedback\nThem [10:20]: you're probably just\nAnant [10:21]: as probably the most\nAnant [10:24]: involved people who's doing hands\nThem [10:24]: on development right now\nThem [10:26]: and\nThem [10:30]: they don't report to me so you are you will probably be more open\nThem [10:31]: to hurting my feelings\nThem [10:31]: and some of my other\nThem [10:32]: engineers\nThem [10:35]: are\nThem [10:36]: you building\nThem [10:37]: ad\nThem [10:37]: ta or\nThem [10:38]: is this like\nThem [10:39]: supposed to be a\nThem [10:40]: package\nThem [10:40]: or\nThem [10:41]: yeah\nThem [10:44]: it's not like an indicator and i shared you\nThem [10:44]: what i was thinking\nThem [10:46]: can you\nThem [10:47]: post on\nThem [10:48]: that\nThem [10:50]: and tell me if you would ever use it\nThem [10:52]: if you come across the same problems\nThem [10:54]: i would love\nThem [10:55]: to i would love to\nThem [10:55]: look at it\nThem [10:58]: and then\nThem [10:59]: i will look at\nThem [11:01]: casual after you do the same thing\nAnant [11:02]: very very\nAnant [11:03]: that sounds great\nAnant [11:07]: and\nAnant [11:11]: i just show you what\nAnant [11:12]: is right\nAnant [11:12]: now\nAnant [11:17]: it's\nAnant [11:18]: from\nAnant [11:37]: thank\nAnant [11:37]: god\nAnant [11:40]: yeah\nAnant [11:42]: it's turn on video front end\nAnant [11:43]: is really good\nAnant [11:44]: i just\nAnant [11:45]: been\nAnant [11:46]: working with\nAnant [11:46]: it\nAnant [11:47]: a couple months\nAnant [11:47]: every year\nAnant [11:49]: the friday is not that great\nAnant [11:50]: either\nAnant [11:54]: i\nAnant [11:54]: could send you the\nAnant [11:55]: rep\nAnant [11:55]: o\nAnant [11:56]: and we've been working\nAnant [11:57]: on front\nAnant [11:57]: end\nAnant [11:58]: since like the last\nAnant [11:58]: two weeks\nAnant [11:59]: before that we\nAnant [12:00]: were just working on\nAnant [12:02]: back end and orchestration\nAnant [12:02]: much of it\nAnant [12:04]: and the mcp\nAnant [12:04]: layer has\nAnant [12:10]: to be shown as a knowledge graph in ui it's a little bit of video looking at that and that's my\nAnant [12:12]: next task to then download them\nAnant [12:13]: knowledge graph first\nThem [12:15]: far\nThem [12:17]: very\nAnant [12:17]: far from the\nAnant [12:20]: shady lovable\nAnant [12:32]: two weeks\nAnant [12:33]: we can see there\nAnant [12:36]: s the entire\nAnant [12:36]: time\nAnant [12:38]: and the primary license right over here\nAnant [12:40]: we're getting that done\nAnant [12:52]: well could you tell me about the 80k that you're developing how is it gonna improve the ai generated code\nAnant [12:55]: yeah\nAnant [12:56]: let me share my screen\nAnant [12:58]: i can show you what i have\nAnant [12:59]: so far\nAnant [13:02]: yeah\nAnant [13:07]: i think i give you permission now\nAnant [13:08]: yeah\nAnant [13:10]: yep\nAnant [13:13]: the first thing is\nAnant [13:14]: there's the\nAnant [13:14]: white house storm\nAnant [13:19]: of calignon there's a cold veins is actually really good for a genetic develop\nAnant [13:20]: ment or not\nAnant [13:22]: like developers who give like odr tests\nAnant [13:24]: but how do you know that\nAnant [13:26]: you\nAnant [13:27]: re coding\nAnant [13:29]: assistance of the choice is\nAnant [13:30]: actually being able to do the job\nAnant [13:39]: properly and i just do research and the things that actually matter our token lives to be final new business reaching out boundary evidence and human discernment\nThem [13:42]: i went to the\nThem [13:47]: world engineering presented a generic commerce and\nThem [14:07]: he was talking about all of these things i was like okay let me take a look at that so the first one\nAnant [14:07]: is kind of like the first feature is kind of like if i was in high repository you can support bible\nAnant [14:07]: organized\nAnant [14:11]: because i wrote it in a way but future generations of the coding is the stuff won't be done\nAnant [14:16]: the next one is shape it's like okay\nAnant [14:18]: scams\nAnant [14:25]: all those files that you need and identifies which are the most expensive ones these ones were like basically giving you overall shape give you the exact\nAnant [14:26]: ones\nAnant [14:28]: sweet is what happens\nAnant [14:30]: i realize\nAnant [14:31]: this\nAnant [14:33]: the air just goes on right code and more and more and\nAnant [14:33]: more and more\nAnant [14:37]: and then the next generation of it it just forgets that decoded\nAnant [14:41]: time i have the same method written in seven different files\nAnant [14:43]: and six of them are not being utilized\nAnant [14:44]: one is the only\nAnant [14:45]: one is to wire them\nAnant [14:48]: wait a minute clean things up so basically\nAnant [14:52]: a dark code things that light and then doesn't need it\nAnant [14:55]: but now it's kind of like in your context window\nAnant [14:56]: and\nAnant [14:57]: just camping out\nAnant [14:57]: the entire\nAnant [14:59]: size of the context\nAnant [15:00]: window\nAnant [15:06]: where it's not cheap anymore so you figure it out specific things of like oh these things are not being utilized\nAnant [15:07]: those are\nAnant [15:07]: comments\nThem [15:08]: and then it'll tell you this\nThem [15:13]: but the most important one is i feel like i'm seeing the sense of like oh my god\nThem [15:15]: you reveal the\nThem [15:15]: pr at\nThem [15:16]: your own\nThem [15:18]: and give\nThem [15:19]: your own risks\nThem [15:19]: it was written\nThem [15:20]: by ai\nAnant [15:22]: no\nAnant [15:23]: you\nAnant [15:24]: remember the crown\nAnant [15:26]: you're responsible\nAnant [15:27]: i\nAnant [15:28]: don't make if the read\nAnant [15:30]: er's problem to be like readers\nAnant [15:30]: or more\nAnant [15:31]: things\nAnant [15:33]: you know yeah\nAnant [15:36]: so i feel like i need to start\nAnant [15:37]: practicing\nAnant [15:38]: practice\nAnant [15:40]: that hey i actually\nAnant [15:41]: the first step is\nAnant [15:42]: like you need to\nAnant [15:42]: self\nAnant [15:44]: reflect that hey\nAnant [15:44]: i didn't write this\nAnant [15:46]: someone else did\nAnant [15:46]: it\nAnant [15:47]: and then\nAnant [15:55]: kind of ranking so i'm levels which is like oh agents can a lot bigger than it should have was written by it so every prn for the publisher would be\nAnant [16:01]: like do you think it was like an agent so i\nThem [16:01]: this was autonom\nAnant [16:05]: based on that we have something called the evidence bundles\nAnant [16:06]: what is happening is like\nThem [16:17]: chat and then the next person to come to go waste and then the right they don't have what you had with your code base with your ai assistance right their conversations\nAnant [16:19]: cannot push everything out there\nAnant [16:23]: but that is how governance used to be that's how good development used to be\nAnant [16:29]: we used to talk about hey i wrote this in a way because this and this that's how many of these works\nAnant [16:34]: i'm trying to say like find that in front of instagram\nAnant [16:35]: being friends\nAnant [16:37]: the files that were actually modified\nAnant [16:38]: the files and people\nAnant [16:40]: taboo should be modified\nAnant [16:42]: and then start pushing them on your deal as well\nAnant [16:45]: and depending on the agency ladder if you're saying\nAnant [16:46]: one\nAnant [16:51]: and then the number of files change versus the number files that should have been changed\nAnant [16:52]: is very tiny then it's great\nAnant [16:54]: but\nAnant [17:00]: to step in this is totally ai and suddenly the bundles tells you whoa\nAnant [17:02]: 75 change but we were already planning\nAnant [17:03]: to only change\nAnant [17:04]: one\nAnant [17:05]: maybe\nThem [17:06]: figure\nThem [17:07]: things out it's like\nAnant [17:17]: when you met it right and this is where like how would you know which ones we're supposed to be modified versus the ones that are actually modified this is where i had the attempted harness with the adx run\nAnant [17:25]: questions it's just a hard answer on the llm and then sixth exam what files i need to change\nAnant [17:31]: kind of like the plan mode but then gives you the context to share it on the algorithms bundle\nThem [17:34]: standing\nAnant [17:42]: i also have things like ddx maintain a lot of times what happens is as the agent will just change up four files\nThem [17:54]: the architecture document that describes everything just because if i like it rw like those are very valuable in end to end test and the end-to-end test was like knocked and it didn't work so they would be like oh\nThem [17:55]: i'll just\nThem [17:56]: comment out this test\nThem [17:57]: you can't do that\nThem [18:05]: right you're just changing now the right trajectory of the future ages of the slow base so adx maintain allows you to\nThem [18:06]: freeze\nThem [18:18]: freeze the intent of a specific line of code so that if your co-pilot\nThem [18:22]: very\nThem [18:25]: like changing the file that you should never be changed\nThem [18:28]: or not changed without human\nThem [18:28]: interaction\nThem [18:33]: so i'm trying to solve like a bunch of these problems that we have\nAnant [18:34]: writing\nAnant [18:35]: code\nAnant [18:42]: so it's like actually the code is good and your probe is different development second of all planning in a way\nAnant [18:46]: and then evidence ladder and then actually forcing us to be like hey\nAnant [18:47]: i\nAnant [18:50]: it\nAnant [18:51]: half i didn't have\nAnant [18:52]: home\nAnant [18:55]: i honestly love it\nAnant [19:03]: except especially the genty ladder thing this the flag level system it's great it's great that's the most tanning part about it\nAnant [19:10]: but i was thinking what would be even better for this is to have a memory layer around it\nAnant [19:19]: like each and every pr gets saved into like a node or like some sort of memory layer\nThem [19:22]: with the evidence directory\nThem [19:33]: 200 prs you will have so much files and they don't get really\nAnant [19:43]: initiative get up repo inside the github repo that has been tracked somewhere else so anytime you're eating something put it over there\nAnant [19:47]: but i do agree i do agree that we should have a memory layer\nAnant [19:55]: and that's what the evidence bundle is supposed to be yeah because like the context window resets every single session and\nAnant [20:10]: you're solving sort of like the 75 of the issue but the agent and the 80k is self forgetting at each and every single pr so like they're almost starting up at a fresh session each and every time\nAnant [20:15]: that the pr gets hosted and if you if this memory layer can be\nAnant [20:24]: i don't know used by other developers on the team it's like you're giving the other developer the entire knowledge base that you've had from your computer on there\nAnant [20:35]: just from that pr like the like the people on your team will know exactly what this pr is about how is it related to me\nAnant [20:43]: and like the memory layer would solve the context window part entirely like it would bring up the 75 bar to like 95 maybe\nAnant [20:49]: because that is exactly what i did for cosa lobs we were facing this memory issue\nAnant [20:53]: and there were too many agents bond up\nAnant [20:59]: and every agent was just dumb as shit they just couldn't yeah exactly\nThem [20:59]: they don't talk to each other\nThem [21:03]: they're not programmed to talk to each other and also we need a memory layer\nThem [21:10]: the other thing is like the memory layer also gives me the idea of like a context graph because like you need to know what's happening\nThem [21:13]: and that sounds like a lot of these\nThem [21:16]: apps are trying to do this have you looked at open hands\nThem [21:23]: basically\nAnant [21:23]: there are\nAnant [21:27]: open platform for cloud computing\nAnant [21:29]: about that\nAnant [21:29]: yeah\nThem [21:35]: so basically they're doing the same thing where it's like you don't have to switch to go further everyone can have the same\nThem [21:41]: you know everyone\nThem [21:41]: agents but then they will have\nThem [21:42]: one\nThem [21:48]: orchestrator and all the orchestrator does is just like a memory layer\nAnant [21:52]: so yeah\nAnant [22:01]: i sent a message if the k1 collaborate addi is money and he just left me on red and then i left sat boy hour sounds like\nAnant [22:05]: a mentor doesn't think it's good enough to collaborate today\nAnant [22:18]: is your mentor isn't i think i follow a github repo of his like a skills rapper that he created\nAnant [22:18]: for three days last week\nAnant [22:28]: two weeks ago and i told him back in the days that i asked him and he never replied to me my mentor and then he's like well now is the time better than never\nAnant [22:40]: and then it was pretty good i hung on with it for two hours that a speaker dinner because he was a speaker and i was also a speaker and i was like right there\nAnant [22:47]: we talked about so many random things from music to code to how it goes in\nAnant [22:48]: cycles\nAnant [22:53]: and i was on like the first\nAnant [23:00]: safe first talk to you not just like i was so cool\nAnant [23:03]: yeah\nThem [23:06]: my god i'm hanging with adi\nThem [23:12]: who is adius mani and why are you being a fanboy and i'm like you're not a coder\nThem [23:20]: yeah it feels like one of us\nAnant [23:33]: probably happier to meet him than he was i did see that in this while\nAnant [23:37]: that's so great that's so great\nAnant [23:44]: well could you do one video look at something specific about adx would you\nAnant [23:50]: except from the knowledge graph would you you want me to look at something specifically\nAnant [23:55]: give you back information or like just an overview of it\nAnant [24:03]: i will\nAnant [24:05]: give me the end of this week\nAnant [24:07]: i'm now active\nAnant [24:12]: and then basically what you could do is take a look at the things that you think is valuable\nAnant [24:15]: things that we think is just non usable\nAnant [24:21]: and period couple of get up issues and the repo itself could be like i think you should look at this issue\nAnant [24:24]: and identity the same thing\nAnant [24:26]: for a lot\nAnant [24:32]: i think everyone has open source right outside open to public\nAnant [24:37]: yeah send it in the chat\nAnant [24:41]: you could you could take a look at it\nAnant [24:55]: but honestly i would just love to look at adx if you can take a look at the entire code base and provide me any feedback that you could give me that'd be great but i think it's like a four person thing\nThem [25:28]: about\nAnant [25:28]: this yeah yeah so it's like it's generated of a research group that this came out of so it was like it was it started off under a professor and then the professor was like this has to be built and then we got eight people on there four people left and now just there are four people working on it over the summer yeah there are a lot of reason\nAnant [25:35]: is this like a world\nAnant [25:46]: good question i i do not know the professor's name i've been working on a new research so i've been hung up with that\nAnant [25:47]: too\nAnant [25:55]: worker from could you repeat that one more time\nAnant [26:15]: oh i'm working on a healthcare project with a new researcher research professor he's he's called jaideep chivas i think he's one of the most famous professors of all time and he bought me on to his healthcare project so i'm training world right now\nAnant [26:19]: finding the uncertainty of the benchmark\nAnant [26:26]: on the low end morals which are like 3 billion parameter like 5 million per hour\nAnant [26:28]: these things\nAnant [26:32]: about\nAnant [26:34]: mandates\nAnant [26:43]: all right\nThem [26:47]: what are things i can do to help\nThem [26:49]: well\nThem [26:51]: not\nThem [26:51]: 10\nThem [26:52]: forward and maybe\nThem [26:54]: a half month that\nThem [26:57]: i want to get my\nThem [26:57]: proof is\nThem [26:58]: actually\nThem [27:00]: not only\nThem [27:05]: i\nThem [27:06]: want to create a\nThem [27:07]: long on\nThem [27:07]: there or\nThem [27:08]: did i keep posting\nThem [27:09]: i want\nThem [27:11]: to keep that website\nThem [27:12]: as like\nThem [27:12]: those stores to all\nThem [27:13]: the information\nThem [27:17]: and i keep posting\nThem [27:18]: that it's not\nThem [27:22]: dangerous\nThem [27:25]: i quitted it all\nThem [27:27]: my resources\nThem [27:31]: so that's that's one part of it\nThem [27:33]: another thing i made\nThem [27:33]: my\nThem [27:34]: profile\nThem [27:39]: i've been getting on handshake and all of that\nThem [27:41]: so\nAnant [27:43]: let's talk about\nAnant [27:45]: this get a profile\nAnant [27:54]: yeah\nAnant [27:58]: these icons and stuff on this live street going on\nAnant [28:03]: i want to grind lead code as well if you could help me with\nAnant [28:22]: and technical interviews particularly but i want to get into some competitive programming tests that companies give out like if you have anything that best buy is giving out you should do have you looked at\nThem [28:22]: cracking the coding interview\nThem [28:24]: crack is that a website\nThem [28:32]: the golden gold standard for getting ready for coding interviews is cracking the code\nAnant [28:37]: okay okay\nAnant [28:57]: it's a bug\nThem [28:58]: so this is you can yeah you can find the pdf version you can do that one and this will help you more than any of the\nThem [28:58]: life and gotten into fang\nThem [29:03]: the other one i would say system design interview questions\nThem [29:09]: so if you want to if you were like also thinking about architecture\nThem [29:20]: there's like a book for it too\nThem [29:21]: okay i'm great\nAnant [30:36]: yeah i've just been recently the other thing that i got i got this one startup that reached out to me talked to her for a while it didn't really work out but i'm trying to invest my time in some particular problem because i've been building too many projects but i'm not doing it entire like completely full on devotion all of that because i want to do something that's interesting to me like\nAnant [31:13]: it was pretty fun to do it it was pretty fun to do it and i genuinely did not use that to do this feel like i should be doing\nThem [31:13]: good but there was like i've just realized from my visit from san francisco that we live in a bubble out in the midwest if you could somehow start applying to apprenticeship in south san francisco or save some money and go there for a month or like only four weeks or three weeks and then figure out all the different events that happen let it be hackathons let it be meetups go go do that\nThem [31:17]: turns out face value is going to be way more than linkedin\nThem [31:53]: and for the first introduction if you once you meet the people then\nAnant [31:54]: messaging them\nThem [31:54]: here in minnesota look at meetups for javascript minnesota make it look up for conferences open source north a good for conferences like minibar mini demo look up data and analytics conferences kind of like i know you were already going to the startup ones right so yeah we've checked out a couple\nAnant [32:23]: about it to talk to you about i've got a planner i've got a planet a roadmap for like building a startup and i'm going to take it seriously for the next two years i'm going to find like a problem statement first build a product find recruiters find all of that while i'm just still doing the building process so i just want to give it a shot for the next two years before i really go out for a job because i got i got two years man i got two years to figure it out\nAnant [32:38]: i can do my internship that's that's gonna happen 100 next year and i still got i still got one year to do it so in that one year i want to work my ass off to hopefully start a startup\nAnant [33:06]: yeah okay save 500 or\nThem [33:06]: 600 to 500 call with me we're gonna go to zoom we're gonna go to what do i use zen business and we're gonna start up here llc okay some other time once you have investors in your product but for to begin with you need an loc let's get you an llc and then once i'll go with you to the us bank and we'll get you a business checking account\nThem [33:19]: so then you have everything that you need to get started from my infrastructure standpoint but you don't need to wait you can start urls without even your lcr own get up organization\nAnant [33:19]: startup your delivery people think about your products\nAnant [33:35]: okay sounds great sounds great i know exactly what he talked about the llc but i gotta dive more into it i don't know the logistics of starting the startup i gotta build up the finance as well\nAnant [33:38]: i got a lot of learning before i dive into it\nThem [34:01]: all right man go to your next\nAnant [34:01]: for the adx thing yeah i'll write it down yeah send me the invite the github and i'll work on it yeah\nThem [34:22]: perfect sounds good thank you yeah i'll try now the next meeting in detail so that we could have a breakdown for what it is do you want to do you want to meet alternate we've been meeting alternative mondays do you want to keep it a weekly meeting for mondays does that work for you\nAnant [34:52]: i\nThem [34:52]: will go live at google gemini and open ai very very soon for some new features so it's been really busy give let's keep it bi-weekly for now but let's revisit this again around september sounds great i'll be back in minneapolis i'll be free the entire time just doing school work great just do schoolwork bro does 20 and then says i will be free\nAnant [34:52]: 22 credits again this time\nThem [35:06]: i don't know but super proud of\nAnant [35:06]: you\nThem [35:06]: man keep keep doing what you're doing thank you thank you so much man well i gotta run she's probably waiting for me over there yeah right\n```\n"}`

Once [[Brief Standard]] was written (2026-08-08), the two roles got split — the brief stays compressed, and this note carries the detail Brief Standard says shouldn't live in a brief. Brief Standard's own text also references a not-yet-written `Action Standard` for what a `/note-to-actions` output should look like structurally; that Standard doesn't exist yet, so this note doesn't claim to conform to one — it's the same real content as before, relocated and lightly updated where reality has since moved past it.\n## 1. Review adx in Depth — Ahnaf's Agent Development Kit\nRepo: [ahnafyy/adx](https://github.com/ahnafyy/adx) (TypeScript, private-ish/0-star, created 2026-07-07 — early and actively developed at the time; confirmed dormant since, see [[Codebase Deep Read]]). This work ended up living at `20_Progress/Mentorship Program/adx/`, not the originally-planned `20_Progress/Projects/CS/ADX/` — the mentorship-specific home made more sense once the review grew into its own note set.\n**What adx actually is, read directly from the repo README, not guessed:** a framework for governing codebases written by autonomous AI coding agents, structured as three pillars:\n- *Measure* — four \"vitals\" scored per repo: **TDS** (Token Density Score — signal-to-noise per file), **FRR** (File Revisit Ratio — how often an agent re-reads the same file, a coupling smell), **BER** (Boundary Evidence Rating — whether CI enforces an evidence bundle before agent code merges), **HDI** (Human Discernment Index — how far up the Agency Ladder engineers actually operate, not rubber-stamp).\n- *Orchestrate* — a harness that runs agents in isolated git worktrees, with a `progress.json` chain-of-thought log and a context backlog, so an agent can't spiral or corrupt the working tree.\n- *Govern* — `adx gate`, a 3-layer check on every diff (abstraction-overhead check, mutation testing to catch tautological test suites, and intent-vs-actual-diff cross-reference) before a human signs off at a required **Agency Ladder** level (1 Flag → 7 Discern; adx defaults to requiring Level 6 Resolve).\nThis is the same shape of problem CausalOps solves on the causal-inference side — evidence over trust, a hard gate instead of a judgment call — which is exactly why Anant's instinct fit.\n**Before raising any issues, understand every part first** (per Anant's own instruction): read the 8 packages in order of dependency — `adx-core` (harness engine, Agency Ladder, config types) → `adx-cli` (entry point) → `adx-shape` (TDS/FRR scanner) → `adx-sweep` (dead-code/orphaned-export detector) → `adx-gate` (the 3-layer evidence boundary + sign-off UI) → `adx-maintain` (frozen path locks + pre-commit hook) → `adx-mcp` (MCP server exposing the 6 tools to IDE agents) → `adx-vscode` (status bar + dashboard extension). **This happened** — see [[Source Claims]], [[Claims vs Implementation]], and the much deeper [[Codebase Deep Read]] pass, which also built and ran the CLI for real against a throwaway repo rather than just reading it.\n**The concrete contribution to raise first:** the memory-layer idea from the meeting — each PR's evidence bundle currently lives as a flat file under `.evidence/`, which becomes unmanageable past ~200 PRs and forces every new agent session to start cold. Anant's proposal: persist evidence bundles into a queryable memory/graph layer (the same problem CausalOps solved with its own memory layer for agents that weren't talking to each other) so a new agent session — or a new teammate — can retrieve what a prior PR actually did and why, instead of re-deriving it. Ahnaf connected this to the \"context graph\" problem and referenced **OpenHands** as a comparable project using a single orchestrator over shared memory instead of duplicated agents — worth a look before writing the issue, so the proposal is differentiated, not a re-invention. **Not yet raised** — this is still queued behind the deeper review; see [[Codebase Deep Read]]'s Next Action.\n**Original deadline:** Ahnaf asked for feedback by 2026-07-19. **That date passed** — the review instead grew into a much deeper multi-session pass ([[Source Claims]] → [[Claims vs Implementation]] → [[Recommended Fixes]] → [[Codebase Deep Read]]'s five notes), which is a real scope change worth naming plainly to Ahnaf rather than pretending the original one-week timeline held.\n## 2. Internship Outreach System — Foundation for 500+ Applications\n**What exists already:** [[Internship - Dashboard]] + [[Programs-to-Create]] — a Dataview-driven tracker scoped to 13 curated, name-brand programs (Wave 1 quant, Wave 2 big tech, Wave 3 banks/specialty), each hand-entered with deadlines and pay. This is a good tracker for a short list. **It is not the system this goal needs** — 500+ applications means most targets won't be famous programs with existing write-ups; they need to be researched one at a time.\n**What's actually new here:** an AI-agent layer, built on Jarvis, that does the research a human would do before a genuinely tailored outreach message — not a mail-merge. Concretely, per the meeting's framing, an agent (or set of agents) that:\n1. Finds real, current information about the target company (recent news, product direction, engineering blog posts).\n2. Identifies actual people — especially HR/recruiting contacts — not just a generic careers-page email.\n3. Surfaces something that shows genuine interest (a specific problem the company is visibly dealing with), not boilerplate enthusiasm.\n4. Feeds that research into a draft that argues, specifically, how Anant's real project work (BOOM, TradingView, CausalOps, Portfolio/Orby) would contribute to *that* company's *actual* problem — not a generic skills list.\n**How this plugs into what already exists, not a rebuild:** the vault already has a `career-operator` agent (`.claude/agents/career-operator.md`) that generates career briefs and outreach drafts, but it has no live web-research step wired in — it reads only vault notes. The foundation work is giving it (or a paired research agent) real tool access — `WebSearch`/`firecrawl-search` for company news, `firecrawl-scrape` for careers pages and engineering blogs, `github search_users`/LinkedIn-search patterns (see [[LinkedIn Premium]] and the LinkedIn Search URL Cheatsheet already ingested) for named contacts — and a fixed output schema (company facts, named contact if found, the one real problem, the one contribution sentence) so 500 of these stay consistent instead of drifting in quality.\n**Where records should live:** the existing `Programs/` folder is schema-built for ~13 elite named programs specifically, not a 500-wide net — a sibling folder (e.g. `10_Areas/Career/Internships/Outreach/`, to create) makes more sense than overloading `Programs/`, so the Wave-based dashboard doesn't get diluted by generic company research records.\n**Timing context:** Wave 1 (quant) applications were open at the time of the meeting; Wave 2 (big tech) opens through October — the 500-application push should front-load onto companies in those windows first, not spread evenly. Given today's date, check [[Internship - Dashboard]] directly for current wave status rather than trusting this snapshot.\n## 3. Portfolio Improvement\nThe meeting's actual portfolio content was narrower than the full UI backlog: Anant confirmed the site is deployed, and separately said he wants the site to become a real running store of his own writing — \"keep that website... to store all the information... keep posting\" — tying directly to the CEO-persona answer already scripted into Orby (\"the next version of this portfolio is going to have a blog platform... he wants to write content without using AI\"). Concretely, this means the **blog section is the actual next portfolio priority**, not the visual UI-fix backlog: the current live blog feed is rendering generic placeholder posts (e.g. \"Building Scalable React Applications with Next.js 14,\" dated Jan 2024 — verified on the live scrape, not a real post), and closing that gap is what Anant himself asked for in the meeting. The 14-item UI-fix backlog (`frontend/BUILD-STATUS.md`) stays a separate, lower-priority track — mention it to Ahnaf only once it ships, per [[Mentor Meeting Playbook]].\n## 4. Resources to Write Down and Implement\nNone of these had vault notes yet at the time this was written (checked — no existing match):\n- **\"Cracking the Coding Interview\"** (to create, likely `40_Resources/CS/`) — Ahnaf's stated gold standard for technical interview prep; get the PDF, work it alongside the existing [[LeetCode & CSCI 4041]] cadence.\n- **\"System Design Interview\"** (the Alex Xu book — to create) — for architecture-focused interview prep, relevant given adx and CausalOps are both real system-design portfolio material.\n- **SF/Bay Area trip idea** (to create, likely `10_Areas/Career/Internships/`) — Ahnaf's advice: 3-4 weeks in South San Francisco doing an apprenticeship or attending hackathons/meetups, because face-to-face networking there outperforms LinkedIn outreach from the Midwest.\n- **Local Minnesota networking list** (to create) — JavaScript Minnesota meetups, Open Source North conference, \"Minibar\"/\"Minidemo\" events, data & analytics conferences — concrete, findable events, not vague \"network more\" advice.\n- **LLC + business bank account** — the concrete first step Ahnaf gave for the startup goal: ~$500-600 to form an LLC (he mentioned a service like ZenBusiness), then a US Bank business checking account — buildable now, doesn't require investors or even a GitHub org first. Belongs with the startup-fundamentals goal in [[Plan#Summer]], not as a standalone resource note.\n## 5. Systems for Every Future Meeting\nThe cadence question resolved: **bi-weekly (alternate Mondays), revisit at the start of September** when Ahnaf is back in Minneapolis — matching what [[Mentor Meeting Playbook]] already proposed as the standing rhythm. One real shift from the pre-meeting plan: Ahnaf explicitly framed adx feedback as the thing he wants most from Anant right now — being outside his direct-report chain makes Anant's critique more useful to him than his own team's. **Between now and September, adx contribution should be the primary currency of this relationship**, ahead of the other three original goals, which stay live but secondary until fall.\n## Pre-Meeting Briefing, Superseded\nBefore the 2026-07-14 call, the note this content originated from held detailed, source-checked briefings on three topics: **Portfolio/Orby** (confirmed live at anantgupta.dev; Orby's grounded-agent architecture and known reliability gaps in its provider-fallback logic), **TradingView** (reframed as a personal, non-revenue quant learning project; 497 passing tests; a working LLM analyst/critic layer producing real evidence-backed stock cards), and **CausalOps** (the evidence-gated causal-reasoning architecture — three-tier agents, deterministic causal engine, memory layer pending a SQL migration). That detail is still accurate as project background from that point in time; it just isn't what the actual meeting ended up covering in depth.\n## Links Into The Vault\n- [[Project Briefings - 2026-07-13]] — the compressed brief this detail supports\n- [[Codebase Deep Read]] — where Section 1's adx review actually landed, far deeper than planned here\n- [[Mentor Meeting Playbook]] — the standing format and Session Log\n- [[Mentor Details]] — the mentor whose program this is\n"}`

Speaker labels in the raw transcript are unreliable — confirmed by Anant — so this brief is built from substance, not attribution. Most of the call ended up being Ahnaf asking Anant to review his own open-source project, **adx**, rather than following the planned four-goals agenda.\n## What Was Decided\n- **Cadence locked at bi-weekly (alternate Mondays)**, to be revisited at the start of September when Ahnaf is back in Minneapolis.\n- **adx contribution becomes the primary currency of the relationship** between now and September — ahead of the program's original four goals, which stay live but secondary until fall.\n- **Startup fundamentals got a concrete first step**: form an LLC (~$500-600, e.g. via ZenBusiness), then open a US Bank business checking account — buildable now, no investors or GitHub org required first.\n## Key Threads\n### adx — the real center of gravity\nAhnaf asked Anant to review adx, his own Agent Development Kit, specifically because Anant isn't a direct report and can give harsher feedback than Ahnaf's own team. Anant proposed adding a memory layer to adx's evidence bundles — persisting each PR's evidence into a queryable graph rather than flat files under `.evidence/`, which becomes unmanageable past ~200 PRs. Ahnaf connected this to the \"context graph\" problem and named **OpenHands** as a comparable project using one orchestrator over shared memory instead of duplicated agents. Original ask: feedback by 2026-07-19. Full technical detail on adx itself: [[adx]], [[Source Claims]], [[Claims vs Implementation]]; the much deeper follow-on pass: [[Codebase Deep Read]]. Full action breakdown: [[2026-07-14 Mentor Meeting — Actions]].\n### Startup fundamentals\nAnant framed his own plan as a 2-year runway with this year devoted to finding a problem statement and building, internship \"100%\" happening next year. Ahnaf's concrete next step: LLC formation, then a business bank account — see What Was Decided above.\n### Professional image\nAhnaf gave two concrete resources: **\"Cracking the Coding Interview\"** (his stated gold standard) and the **\"System Design Interview\"** book (Alex Xu). Separately advised 3-4 weeks in the Bay Area for in-person networking — hackathons and meetups outperform LinkedIn cold outreach from the Midwest — and named local Minnesota options (JavaScript Minnesota, Open Source North, Minibar/Minidemo, data & analytics conferences).\n### Portfolio and TradingView/CausalOps\nTradingView wasn't discussed this call. Portfolio/Orby was barely touched — only that the deploy is confirmed live and Anant wants the site to become a genuine ongoing writing store, not AI-generated content. CausalOps came up once, as a concrete example of the \"agents not sharing memory\" problem — this is what directly informed the adx memory-layer proposal above, not as its own discussion thread.\n## Open Questions\n- [ ] The raw transcript is heavily garbled by the Cluely capture (fragmented, word-by-word lines, several passages where the speaker's actual meaning doesn't survive the transcription) — several minutes of the call (roughly the 22:00–30:00 mark, covering a tangent about Ahnaf's own mentor) aren't confidently reconstructable and are omitted from this brief rather than guessed at.\n- [ ] Whether the 2026-07-19 feedback deadline mattered to Ahnaf once it passed, given the review grew into a multi-session pass instead — worth asking directly rather than assuming it's forgotten.\n- [ ] Whether Ahnaf's \"80k\" references throughout the transcript (a transcription artifact) are worth a clean pass to confirm every occurrence really means \"adx\" — spot-checked, not exhaustively verified.\n## Follow-Up Actions\n- [ ] Raise the adx memory-layer proposal as a real GitHub issue, once [[Codebase Deep Read]]'s review is judged ready — see its own Next Action.\n- [ ] Full detail on every thread above, plus items not central enough for this brief (internship outreach system design, portfolio blog prioritization, resource list): [[2026-07-14 Mentor Meeting — Actions]].\n## Related Notes\n- [[Mentor Meeting Playbook]] — the standing format this call followed, and its Session Log's 2026-07-14 entry\n- [[2026-07-14 Mentor Meeting — Actions]] — the full link-dense action breakdown\n- [[adx]], [[Codebase Deep Read]] — where the adx thread actually went\n- [[Mentor Details]] — the mentor whose program this is\n- [[Plan]] — the standing goals document this call's cadence decision updates\n"}`

Scope the Factory-comparison/positioning GitHub issue separately from the concrete bug-fix issues — see [[Competitive Positioning]].\"\n---\n# adx — Recommended Fixes\n==Everything below is a recommendation, not a fact — the factual record lives in [[Source Claims]], [[Claims vs Implementation]], and the five [[Codebase Deep Read|Codebase\\]] notes; this note exists solely to turn those findings into one prioritized, actionable list.==\n## Goal\nTurn every gap and discrepancy found across the static-reading pass ([[Source Claims]], [[Claims vs Implementation]], 2026-07-22) and the deeper, run-it-for-real pass ([[Codebase Deep Read]] and its five notes, 2026-08-07/08) into a single list — prioritized by what actually blocks the most, not by which pass found it. This is a real rewrite, not an appended patch: every item below was re-read against current evidence, and each one says whether it was hardened with new proof, stays as originally stated, or is new this pass.\n## 0. Distribution — Fix Before Anything Else Matters\nNothing below is reachable if a new user can't install the tool. This tier didn't exist in the original list; it outranks every item that did.\n- [ ] **Resolve the npm package-name collision.** `adx` on the real npm registry is a real, unrelated, essentially-empty package from 2019 (confirmed via `npm view adx` and an actual clean install — no working CLI results from it). Every one of the 8 packages uses the bare unscoped name, and `.changeset/config.json`'s release group is built around it — this was never a scoping mistake, and the package cannot currently be published to npm at all as configured. Real options: rename to a scoped package (`@ahnafyy/adx` or similar, immediate and free) or negotiate for the existing name (unpredictable, slow). Full detail: [[Distribution and Adoption Gaps]].\n- [ ] **Add a LICENSE.** No `LICENSE` file exists at the repo root, and no `package.json` across all 8 packages declares a `license` field either — not even the file, not even the metadata. A real adoption blocker for any team doing dependency due diligence, independent of whether the code works.\n## 1. Integrity Fixes — Highest Priority\nThese touch the product's actual accountability claim, not just its polish. Three of four items here are now backed by live reproduction, not a single reading of the source.\n- [ ] **Capture a real signer identity.** `signedBy` is hardcoded to the literal string `'engineer'` in `packages/adx-gate/src/gate.ts` on every gate run, interactive or not. **Hardened:** reproduced live today against a fresh throwaway repo — the agency ledger entry read exactly `\"signedBy\": \"engineer\"`, matching the tool's own dogfooded history from July. Read `git config user.name` (or an equivalent identity source) instead.\n- [ ] **Stop auto-approving Level 6 in CI with zero human input.** `packages/adx-gate/src/ui.ts` sets `agencyLevel: AgencyLevel.Resolve` on any non-blocked CI run. **Hardened, and stronger than originally stated:** tested three separate `adx.config.ts` variations (`minimumHumanAgencyRequired: AgencyLevel.Flag`, `enforceTasteCheck: false`, `minimumAdxScore: 99`) — every run produced an identical result. This isn't a config gap a team could close themselves; the CI path doesn't read `boundary` config at all. Either record CI-only approvals at a distinct, clearly-lower level, or require an explicit human step before Level 6 can ever be recorded.\n- [ ] **`--exec` provisions a real isolated worktree and never uses it for the actual agent call.** `harness.ts` passes the worktree path to `assembleContext()` and `runVerificationHooks()` correctly — only `adapter.complete()`, the call that actually runs the agent, never receives it. **New this pass, proven live:** polled `git worktree list` mid-run and caught a real second worktree existing simultaneously with a file-write probe whose own reported `pwd` was the main repo root. This has been true since the very first commit that introduced `adx run` (`d1edd4e`) — not a regression. Full detail: [[Safety-Critical Gaps]].\n- [ ] **`adx maintain override` — the fix the tool's own pre-commit hook tells a blocked user to run — doesn't exist.** Confirmed by running it (`ERROR Unknown command override`) and by searching full git history (never committed at any point). Docs present it as a real subcommand in the same style as the three that work; the hook prints the identical syntax when it fires. **New this pass.** Either implement it or stop telling users it exists.\n- [ ] **Reconcile the gate's actual blocking logic with the documented \"score below 60 blocks merge\" threshold.** The code blocks on three unrelated booleans (`abstraction.flagged`, any tautological test, more than 3 drifted files), with no reference to the numeric score. **Not re-tested empirically this pass** — code hasn't changed since July, no reason to doubt the original finding, but this pass didn't specifically re-run it.\n- [ ] **Fix or reword the \"import cycles always score 0\" claim.** The code gives cyclic files a flat +0.5 risk bonus, not a forced floor. **Not re-tested empirically this pass** — same status as above, still live and unchanged in the docs as of this session's live-docs recheck.\n## 2. Safety — Things That Can Corrupt or Destroy Real Work\n- [ ] **Mutation testing can permanently corrupt a real source file if interrupted mid-run.** `runMutationTest()` writes a mutated file to disk, runs the test command, then restores the original in a `finally` block — which never runs if the process is killed. **New this pass, proven, not inferred:** `SIGKILL`'d a real run ~200ms into a 10-second test window; the file was left permanently mutated (`true` → `false`), with zero warning. Full detail: [[Safety-Critical Gaps]].\n- [ ] **`provisionWorktree`/`teardownWorktree` swallow every failure silently.** Both catch blocks are comment-only, no logging — a user cannot tell \"isolation wasn't requested\" from \"isolation failed unexpectedly.\" **New this pass.**\n- [ ] **Document `adx sweep --fix` / `--auto` / `--dry-run` / `--comments`.** All four exist and work; the CLI's own `--help` text now describes them, but the public docs site still doesn't (re-checked live this session). **Unchanged** from the original finding.\n- [ ] **Decide `adx sweep --auto`'s CI posture explicitly.** **Unchanged.**\n## 3. Process and CI — Why Bugs Ship and Survive\nNew tier this pass — the original review didn't look at the project's own build/typecheck/CI tooling at all.\n- [ ] **Wire `pnpm typecheck` into CI, and fix `pnpm -r`'s bail-on-first-failure so it can't hide a whole package's errors.** `.github/workflows/adx.yml` runs only `pnpm build` and `pnpm test` — no typecheck step exists anywhere in it. The root `pnpm typecheck` script does exist, but `pnpm -r run typecheck`'s default behavior aborts at the first package failure (`adx-gate`'s own separate, day-one `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` errors), so `adx-cli` — where the crash below lives — never gets checked in the intended workflow. **New this pass, and the single highest-leverage fix found this session:** TypeScript itself catches the crash bug instantly when run in isolation; this is the only reason it shipped and survived a month. Full trace: [[Process and CI Gaps]].\n- [ ] **Fix the 8 real, currently-uncaught TypeScript errors.** 2 in `adx-gate/src/ui.ts` (present since the first commit), 6 in `adx-cli` (`init-mcp.ts`'s `generateCopilotInstructions is not defined`, 4 in `maintain.ts`, 1 in `run.ts`). **New this pass** — confirmed via `pnpm --filter adx run typecheck` (the package's real name is `adx`, not `adx-cli`).\n- [ ] **Fix `adx init`'s unconditional crash.** `generateCopilotInstructions()` was correctly defined in `init.ts` at commit `7bda28e`, then dropped when that file was split into `init-agents.ts`/`init-generators.ts`/`init-mcp.ts` at `d5d2610` — a refactor meant to fix a file adx's own tooling would flag as bloated. Reproduced across every flag combination (`--force`, `--worktree`, bare). **New this pass, and arguably the most severe single bug found** — the tool's own onboarding command has never worked since that split, and nothing catches it (see above). Full detail: [[Dead-on-Arrival Code]].\n- [ ] **Unify the two BER implementations.** The CLI's `computeBER` and the MCP tool's inline calculation diverge. **Hardened with live numbers:** on the identical throwaway-repo state, the CLI reported `ber.score: 100` and the MCP tool reported `ber: 50` — a 15-point swing in the composite ADX score (97 vs. 82) from the same code. The MCP version carries its own `// Minimal BER` comment — it was written as a deliberately simplified stand-in, not accidental drift, and never reconciled with the real `computeBER`.\n- [ ] **Regenerate the stale README badge.** `.adx/badge.json` reads 79/100; the repo's own `d5d2610` commit message says \"ADX score: 79→85/100\" and the badge file was never updated to match. A fresh run today confirms 85/100 is current. **New this pass.**\n- [ ] **Populate `test-log.txt` for real.** `packages/adx-gate/src/gate.ts` hardcodes `testLog: ''` on every run. **Not re-tested empirically this pass** — code unchanged, original finding stands.\n- [ ] **Fix the `harness.context.memory` type mismatch.** Docs say `'disk' | 'none'`; code type is `'disk' | 'memory'`. **Unchanged.**\n## 4. Dead Code / Config Cleanup\n- [ ] **Either implement `router` or remove it from the type.** `harness.control.router` accepts three values; nothing in `harness.ts` ever reads it. **Hardened:** reconfirmed via direct grep this pass — zero references anywhere.\n- [ ] **Wire `enforceTasteCheck` into the gate, or delete the flag.** Taste analysis runs unconditionally regardless of its value. **Hardened, and the docs got worse, not better:** the live docs site now explicitly states this flag controls \"whether to run the taste deficit analysis... as part of `adx gate`\" — a more specific, more confidently false claim than what the July review found.\n- [ ] **Make `requireExplanationInvariants` actually contextual, or redocument it honestly.** Any non-empty list triggers one blanket prompt regardless of category. **Hardened, same pattern:** the live docs now explicitly assert \"the gate checks diff content to detect these\" — directly contradicted by `ui.ts`'s actual `.length > 0` check.\n- [ ] **Remove `harness.hooks.maxRetries`, or implement it.** Typed, defaulted to 3, written into every generated config — never read by the actual retry loop, which just continues unconditionally up to `maxIterations`. **New this pass**, same shape as `router`.\n- [ ] **Include the taste-deficit score in the gate score, or explicitly label it advisory-only.** **Unchanged.**\n- [ ] **Publish a reference page for `adx ratchet`, or stop listing it as a peer command to `adx gate`.** No CLI subcommand exists. **Hardened with a new nuance:** confirmed live that the MCP tool `adx_ratchet` genuinely works (called it directly, got a real response) — it's specifically the CLI surface that's missing, not the whole feature.\n- [ ] **Fix or remove `adx-intellij`'s dead Tools-menu actions and broken `getFileTds`.** `plugin.xml` registers two actions whose classes were never committed in any commit, ever. `AdxService.getFileTds()`'s regex expects a JSON shape (`tdsScore`) that matches the MCP server's output, not the CLI's real nested `tds.score` shape — but the Kotlin code calls the CLI. **New this pass** — this whole package wasn't reviewed in the original pass at all. Full detail: [[Dead-on-Arrival Code]].\n- [ ] **Extract `fileExists()` and `bar()` into shared utilities.** `fileExists()` is copy-pasted verbatim across 5 files in `adx-cli`; `bar()` (progress-bar rendering) is reimplemented with diverging parameters across 4 files. **New this pass** — real, if minor, code-quality debt in the exact shape adx's own tooling exists to catch.\n- [ ] **Fix `.tsx` import resolution in `adx-shape`.** `resolveImport()` always appends a literal `.ts`, so any `.tsx`-to-`.tsx` import silently fails to resolve — undercounts FRR and misses cycles on any React/JSX codebase. **New this pass**, untested by the package's own test suite.\n- [ ] **Fix the broken logic/type split in `adx sweep`'s orphan scoring.** `sweep.ts`'s `logicOrphans` filter has an unused loop variable that degenerates to a pure capitalization check; the real fix requires `extractExports` to actually carry the AST declaration kind through, which it currently discards. **New this pass.**\n## 5. Documentation Fixes\n- [ ] **Update the Configuration Reference** to match the actual `AgenticConfig` type (`tests` also accepts `mocha`/`pytest`/`custom`, `telemetry` also accepts `latency`/`cost`, `onSlip` also accepts `notify-only`, `requireExplanationInvariants` also accepts `auth`/`data-schema`/`api-contract`). **Unchanged** — confirmed still live as of this session's docs recheck.\n- [ ] **Disclose the undocumented internal formulas** (TDS 0.6/0.4, FRR 0.15/0.25/0.5, gate score 0.4/0.4/0.2). **Unchanged.**\n- [ ] **Caveat `estimatedTokens` as an approximation.** **Unchanged.**\n- [ ] **Cite a real source for the \"7–8% fewer tokens, 34% fewer file revisits\" claim, or stop stating it as fact.** No benchmark file, dataset, or citation exists anywhere in the repo or docs for these specific numbers — they appear in `abstraction.ts`'s comment and two READMEs, with \"34%\" reused for a different, unrelated claim in the second one. **New this pass.** Full detail: [[Distribution and Adoption Gaps]].\n- [ ] **Document the `adx-vscode` extension** — install path, marketplace link, what its \"run gate\" command actually does. **Unchanged.**\n- [ ] **Document `adx-intellij` at all** — it currently has zero mentions anywhere: not the README's package table, not the docs site, not `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (correctly, since it's Gradle/Kotlin). **New this pass.**\n- [ ] **Document that MCP's `adx_gate_check` only runs Layer 1.** **Hardened:** called it live this pass and confirmed the response shape genuinely contains only abstraction-analysis fields — no mutation or intent-cross-reference data at all.\n## 6. Repo Hygiene\n- [ ] **Stop tracking `.adx/state/progress.json` and the file under `.adx/tasks/`.** **Not re-verified this pass** — carried forward from the original finding.\n- [ ] **Decide how `.evidence/` is meant to persist long-term.** **Unchanged.**\n- [ ] **Automate evidence-bundle rotation.** **Unchanged.**\n## 7. Precision Improvements — Lower Priority\n- [ ] **Move frozen-path matching from substring/suffix to real path-boundary matching**, in both `packages/adx-maintain/src/frozen.ts` and the generated shell hook. **Hardened:** reconfirmed the matching logic is unchanged, and confirmed the package's own test suite still only covers exact-prefix cases, never the adjacent-but-unrelated false-positive case.\n- [ ] **Guard against a pre-existing pre-commit hook that exits early.** **Unchanged.**\n## Why This List Exists\n[[adx]], [[Claims vs Implementation]], and the five [[Codebase Deep Read|Codebase\\]] notes describe what adx claims and what it actually does. This is the only note in the set that contains a recommendation — everything above is judgment, not fact, and should be read as a starting point for a conversation with Ahnaf, not a verdict on the project. Positioning material (the Factory AI comparison) deliberately isn't folded in here — see [[Competitive Positioning]] and the note below on issue scoping.\n## Open Questions\n- [ ] Which of these does Ahnaf already know about, versus which are genuine blind spots worth raising directly?\n- [ ] Does he want this list raised all at once, or scoped down to the highest-leverage items — Section 0 and the `adx init` crash — for a first conversation?\n- [ ] Per standing direction: the eventual GitHub issue set should keep exactly one issue scoped to the Factory-comparison/positioning angle ([[Competitive Positioning]]), separate from the concrete bug-fix issues drawn from Sections 0–4 above. Don't blend that scoping decision away when issues actually get opened.\n## Links Into The Vault\n- [[adx]] — judgment-level synthesis this list was originally extracted from\n- [[Source Claims]] — what adx claims about itself\n- [[Claims vs Implementation]] — the file-level evidence behind the July-era items above\n- [[Codebase Deep Read]] — the index for all five notes behind everything marked \"hardened\" or \"new this pass\"\n- [[Safety-Critical Gaps]], [[Process and CI Gaps]], [[Dead-on-Arrival Code]], [[Distribution and Adoption Gaps]], [[Competitive Positioning]] — the five notes themselves\n- [[Mentor Details]] — the mentor whose project this is\n## Log\n- **2026-07-22:** Extracted every fix implied by [[adx]] and [[Claims vs Implementation]] into this dedicated punch list, and trimmed recommendation language out of both of those notes so the full four-note set separates fact from judgment cleanly.\n- **2026-08-08:** Full rewrite, not an append. Added Section 0 (distribution — the npm collision, which now leads the whole list) and Section 3 (process/CI — the root cause of the `adx init` crash). Cross-checked every item from the original list against the five [[Codebase Deep Read]] notes: marked each as hardened with new live evidence, unchanged and not re-tested this pass, or new. Added dead code, documentation, and code-quality items the original static-reading pass couldn't have found without running the CLI, calling the MCP server live, and reading full commit history.\n"}`

This note checks the layer before that: can a new user actually get adx onto their machine by following the docs, and would a team doing real due diligence stop before they even try. Both checks came from a lead flagged mid-review, verified independently here, not taken on report.\n## Key Claims\n- **The npm package name `adx` is already taken by an unrelated party.** `npm install -g adx` — literally the first command in the getting-started docs — installs a different, dead package, silently, with no error.\n- **This isn't a docs typo for a correctly-scoped name.** Every package in the monorepo uses the bare, unscoped name (`adx-cli/package.json`'s real `name` is `\"adx\"`); `.changeset/config.json` links release versioning around that same bare name. The intent was always the unscoped name.\n- **The package is currently unpublishable to npm as configured**, independent of the docs — npm doesn't allow publishing over an existing unscoped name under a different owner.\n- **No LICENSE file exists anywhere in the repository**, and no package.json across all 8 packages declares a `license` field either.\n- **adx's own \"7–8% fewer tokens, 34% fewer file revisits\" claim has no citation anywhere** — not in the repo, not on the docs site, not as a linked study.\n## Full Content\n### `npm install -g adx` installs the wrong package, with zero error\n==Verified two independent ways: `npm view adx` against the real registry, and an actual `npm install` in a clean directory — both confirm a real, unrelated, essentially-empty package with no functioning CLI at all.==\n```\n$ npm view adx\nadx@0.0.0 | MIT | deps: none | versions: 1\nmaintainers: youlingred <30897863@qq.com>\npublished over a year ago\ncreated: 2019-05-28\n```\nInstalled fresh in an isolated directory (not the sandbox clone, not the throwaway repo):\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"adx\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"author\": \"xiehui <30897863@qq.com>\",\n  \"license\": \"MIT\"\n}\n```\nNo `index.js` file actually shipped in the tarball — `find` on the installed package returned only `package.json`. No `.bin` entry was created. This package predates Ahnaf's project by seven years and has nothing to do with it. A user who runs the exact first command on `ahnafyy.github.io/adx/getting-started/` gets a silent, successful install of an empty package with no `adx` command afterward — not an error, not a wrong-version warning, nothing that would tell them something's off.\n### This was never a scoping mistake — the bare name was always the intent\n==Every one of the 8 packages uses an unscoped name; the changeset release config groups them by that same bare `\"adx\"` string. This is a genuine collision, not a docs command that forgot a `@scope/`.==\n```\npackages/adx-cli/package.json:      \"name\": \"adx\",\npackages/adx-sweep/package.json:    \"name\": \"adx-sweep\",\npackages/adx-vscode/package.json:   \"name\": \"adx-vscode\",\n... (all 8 packages, all unscoped)\n```\n`.changeset/config.json`: `\"linked\": [[\"adx\", \"adx-core\", \"adx-shape\", \"adx-gate\", \"adx-sweep\", \"adx-maintain\"]]` — the release-versioning group is built around the literal string `\"adx\"`. No `publishConfig` field anywhere in any package.json, no `.npmrc`, no registry override in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Nothing in the repository suggests a scoped name (`@ahnafyy/adx` or similar) was ever the plan.\n\nThis makes it worse than a documentation bug: even if `getting-started.md` were rewritten today with the correct install command, there isn't a correct command to write, because **`npm publish` on the current package as configured will fail outright** — npm requires unscoped package names to be globally unique, and this one belongs to someone else. The only real fixes are renaming the package (to a scoped name, e.g. `@ahnafyy/adx`) or acquiring the existing name from its current maintainer. Both are bigger changes than a docs edit.\n### No LICENSE — not the file, not even the metadata field\n==Checked both: no `LICENSE` file at the repository root, and no `package.json` across all 8 packages declares a `license` field at all.==\n```\n$ ls | grep -i licen\n(no output)\n$ grep -H '\"license\"' packages/*/package.json\n(no output)\n```\nThe unrelated squatted npm package at least declares `\"license\": \"MIT\"` in its metadata — Ahnaf's own packages don't, anywhere. For a team doing real adoption due diligence on a dependency, an npm registry page (if this were ever published) showing \"License: not specified\" is itself a stop-and-ask-legal moment, separate from and prior to any question about whether the tool works.\n### The tool's own precision claim has no source\n==`abstraction.ts`'s comment states specific numbers — \"7–8% fewer tokens,\" \"34% fewer file revisits\" — as empirical fact. No benchmark file, dataset, citation, or methodology note exists anywhere in the repository or docs site.==\n```\n// Empirically, clean code with a high signal-to-noise ratio costs 7–8% fewer\n// tokens for agents to process and requires 34% fewer file revisits during\n// investigation.\n```\nThe same numbers get restated as flat claims in two separate `README.md` files (`adx-gate/README.md` and `adx-shape/README.md`) — and in the second one, \"34%\" is repurposed for a conceptually different claim (\"agents spend 34% of their session re-reading files they've already seen\") rather than the file-revisit-count framing used everywhere else. Searched the full repo and docs site for any benchmark file, dataset, results directory, or the words \"study\"/\"whitepaper\"/\"benchmark\"/\"citation\" anywhere near these numbers: nothing. See [[Competitive Positioning]] for how this compares to Factory AI's own published methodology, which turned out to have a real but different gap.\n## Why It Matters\nEvery other note in this folder assumes a reader already has adx installed and running. This is the layer before that, and it's currently broken in a way the other findings aren't: silent, not loud. A crashing `init` command at least tells you something's wrong. A wrong package installing cleanly under the right name doesn't — a new user just gets confused later, with no error message pointing back here.\n## Links Into The Vault\n- [[Codebase Deep Read]] — index for this whole pass\n- [[Competitive Positioning]] — the citation-gap finding here has a direct, sourced parallel in how Factory AI's own scoring methodology turned out to be disclosed\n- [[Source Claims]] — captured the getting-started page's exact install sequence (`npm install -g adx && adx init` etc.) this note checks the first step of\n- [[Recommended Fixes]] — none of its existing items cover distribution; this is new ground\n## Open Questions\n- [ ] Is renaming to a scoped package (`@ahnafyy/adx`) or negotiating for the existing name the right call? Scoped names are free and immediate; acquiring an inactive name from its owner is unpredictable and can take a long time.\n- [ ] Does Ahnaf know the package has never actually been published to npm under any name — or was this assumed working because `npm install -g adx` \"looks like\" a normal, working instruction?\n"}`

No issues open until that gets a separate go-ahead.\n---\n# adx — Codebase Deep Read (MOC)\n==Nobody can currently install this tool by following its own docs — `npm install -g adx` silently installs an unrelated, dead package from 2019 — and everything else in this folder describes what happens once you get past that, using a build from source instead.==\n## Goal\nGet past \"the code matches the docs, or it doesn't\" into \"here's what actually happens when this runs, proven by running it\" — before any of it becomes a GitHub issue or a document for Ahnaf. This folder is the second code-level pass, two weeks after [[Claims vs Implementation]] and one month after the repository itself last changed.\n## What This Pass Covered That the Original Didn't\nThe July review read every non-test `.ts` file across all 8 packages. This pass:\n- Read the test files themselves, the CLI command wrappers, the harness's supporting modules, `adx-vscode`'s webview content, and `adx-intellij` — a Kotlin IntelliJ plugin that existed in the repository the whole time but was never mentioned in the original four notes or, as it turns out, anywhere in adx's own README or docs site.\n- Built the CLI from source and ran it directly against a disposable throwaway repo (`~/projects/ai/claude/adx-worktree-throwaway-test/`, kept on disk, not deleted) — `init`, `run --exec`, `gate --ci`, `maintain`, `sweep`, across multiple flag and config combinations.\n- Started the MCP server for real and called all 6 tools through an actual client, not just read the handler code.\n- Read every substantive commit's diff, not just the current file state — this is how the `adx init` crash got traced to its exact origin, and how the BER-score-jump commit's real mechanism got found.\n- Checked the layer before all of that: whether a new user can actually get the tool onto their machine, and whether the license/citation surface would survive real due diligence.\n- Confirmed, via `gh api` and `git fetch origin`, that nothing has changed in the real repository since 2026-07-07 — a month of dormancy, not ongoing development.\n## Corrections to the Existing Notes\n- **[[Claims vs Implementation]]**'s \"Repository Reality Check\" section states *\"`git log --oneline` returns exactly one commit\"*. This was a shallow-clone (`--depth 1`) artifact — the real history is 17 commits across a single 3-hour window on 2026-07-06/07. Confirmed directly: nothing was rewritten or force-pushed; the original clone simply never fetched full history. Nothing else in that note changes — the code state it reviewed and the code state reviewed here are identical. Flagged here for a deliberate edit to that note later, not changed in place — see [[Process and CI Gaps]] for the full detail.\n## The Five New Notes\n- [[Distribution and Adoption Gaps]] — **read this one first.** The npm package name `adx` is already taken by an unrelated, essentially-empty package from 2019; the getting-started docs' first command silently installs the wrong thing. No LICENSE file, no `license` field in any package.json. Adoption-funnel problems, not code bugs — nobody can reach the code the way the docs describe at all.\n- [[Safety-Critical Gaps]] — the harness's isolation, verification, and governance mechanisms, tested against the exact conditions (unattended runs, interrupted processes, CI with no human watching) they're built for. Packages: `adx-core`, `adx-gate`, `adx-maintain`.\n- [[Process and CI Gaps]] — why the worst code bug found this pass shipped and survived: TypeScript catches it instantly, and nothing in this project's pipeline ever asks TypeScript. Also: a stale self-reported score, and a live-reproduced metric divergence. Packages: `adx-cli`, `adx-core`, `adx-gate`, the root tooling.\n- [[Dead-on-Arrival Code]] — commands, config fields, and a whole package (`adx-intellij`) that exist but don't do what they claim, organized by failure shape. Packages: `adx-cli`, `adx-core`, `adx-mcp`, `adx-intellij`, `adx-shape`, `adx-sweep`, `adx-vscode`.\n- [[Competitive Positioning]] — real, sourced Factory AI research, done after an earlier version of this note correctly flagged itself as unresearched. The comparison is sharper than the version it replaces, and one part of the original framing didn't survive verification — corrected in place, not quietly dropped.\n## The Single Best Insight From This Pass\nadx's actual claim to novelty — per [[adx]]'s own Competitive Read — is the three-pillar bundle, and the idea doing the real conceptual work inside it is the Agency Ladder: forcing genuine human accountability instead of rubber-stamping. [[Safety-Critical Gaps]] shows that mechanism is exactly the one currently faked — CI auto-approves Level 6 with a hardcoded `signedBy: 'engineer'`, unaffected by any config. [[Competitive Positioning]] found the sharper version of this point: Factory AI doesn't do accountability better than adx — it doesn't attempt accountability at all, on any of its products. adx is trying to solve a harder, more valuable problem than its nearest competitor even attempts, and the part of adx that tries to solve it doesn't work yet.\n## Methodology\nEvery finding in these five notes is one of four things, and each note says which: read directly in source, reproduced by running the built CLI or MCP server against a throwaway repo, traced through `git show`/`git log` on the actual commit that introduced or broke it, or independently verified against a live external source (npm registry, Factory AI's own docs) rather than taken on report. Nothing here is a single observation standing alone — claims that started as one observation were deliberately re-tested across flag combinations, config variations, repeated runs, or independent sources before being written down.\n## Open Questions\n- [ ] Which of these findings does Ahnaf already know about? The mentorship framing (per [[Mentor Details]] and the original meeting transcript) is that he wants the harsh read specifically because he can't get it from his own team — worth checking directly rather than assuming any of this is news.\n- [ ] Does the npm name collision change the order of operations for raising anything with him — it's arguably more urgent than the `adx init` crash, since it blocks a first-time user one step earlier and with zero error signal.\n- [ ] See each individual note's Open Questions for narrower follow-ups.\n## Next Action\nDecide what becomes a GitHub issue, and how the issue set is split (concrete bug-fix issues, the one Factory-positioning issue already scoped, and now potentially a distribution/naming issue). Per standing instruction, no issues get opened until that decision gets a separate go-ahead.\n## Log\n- **2026-08-07:** Read every file the July pass hadn't (tests, CLI wrappers, harness internals, `adx-vscode` webview, `adx-intellij`); built and ran the CLI against a throwaway repo; found and root-caused the `adx init` crash; found the `--exec` worktree bypass and proved it with a live file-write probe; found and reproduced mutation-testing crash-corruption; started the MCP server for real and called all 6 tools, surfacing a live BER divergence and a third JSON-schema shape; confirmed via `gh api` that the real repository has had zero commits since 2026-07-07; wrote this note plus [[Safety-Critical Gaps]], [[Process and CI Gaps]], [[Dead-on-Arrival Code]], and a first, deliberately unresearched version of [[Competitive Positioning]].\n- **2026-08-08:** Verified the npm package-name collision independently (registry query + real clean install); confirmed no LICENSE file or license metadata anywhere; confirmed adx's 7–8%/34% claim has zero citation; wrote [[Distribution and Adoption Gaps]]. Did the real Factory AI research owed from the first pass — found the accountability-comparison framing was directionally right but needed a real correction (Factory doesn't out-perform adx's Agency Ladder, it doesn't attempt that problem at all), and found Factory's own published methodology has an undisclosed-validation gap paralleling adx's uncited numbers. Rewrote [[Competitive Positioning]] in place with sourced findings.\n- **2026-08-08 (same day, continued):** Full sweep of the entire Mentorship Program\\ folder, not just adx\\ — fixed a genuinely empty frontmatter on [[Mentor Meeting Transcript]] (a prior fix claim for this had not actually saved), fixed a broken wikilink in [[Plan]] (`Arc (Learning Tracker)` → the real note [[Learning Tracker tool]]), rewrote [[Project Briefings - 2026-07-13]] to actually conform to the new Brief Standard and split its detailed content into [[2026-07-14 Mentor Meeting — Actions]], and fully rewrote [[Recommended Fixes]] — not appended to — folding in every Codebase\\ finding with each item marked as hardened, unchanged, or new.\n"}`
