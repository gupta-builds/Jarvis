# Claude home directory sync verification

## You

Review your own settings(`/home/anant_gupta/.claude`) and other .claude related files. Also review the `/home/anant_gupta/.mcp.json`, `/home/anant_gupta/.claude.json`. I want you to go through the markdown files and .json files in extreme detail. Compare the setup to what exists inside windows. You can do this through jarvis first(`D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\20_Progress\AI\Claude Code\.claude_windows`). After getting the basic information, dive into the actual windows home directory for further context (`PS C:\Users\Anant Gupta\.claude>`). This is first a comparison between windows and wsl settings. How exactly do we get these two to match each other? Without over complicating things, I want both of these home directories to not repeat the same mistakes. The conversation capture especially, it was working for windows for a while but wsl was not working at all. That's why we established these folders inside jarvis(`D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\20_Progress\AI\Claude Code\.claude_wsl`, `D:\Users\_Anant\10_Areas\Documents\Jarvis\20_Progress\AI\Claude Code\.claude_windows`). To have a deeper understanding of what exactly is going on with the home directories in both os. Review what gets syced to jarvis as well, previously we had an entire copy of .claude folder but now this is a live sync with much specifc content in it. What exactly are we syncing and what are we not syncing? Do an entire verification on the sync process as well as what exists in jarvis. Make no changes anywhere, just come back with a detailed overview of what task has been provided to you.

## Claude

I'll start by mapping out the WSL-side `.claude` setup, then check what's accessible in Jarvis and on the Windows filesystem via WSL mount.

C: and presumably D: drives are mounted under `/mnt/`, so I can read the Windows home directory and Jarvis folders directly. Let me explore both in parallel.

Found a `Sync - Unison.md` file which likely documents the sync process. Let me dig into the Jarvis sync folders and that file, plus compare the core config files.

This gives me the sync architecture. Now let me check the actual mirror `Setup.md`/`Sync-Log.md` files, the live manifest/driver script, and the top-level config files (`.claude.json`, `.mcp.json`) on both OSes, plus hooks related to conversation capture.

Now let's inspect the actual sync manifest/driver, the live hooks configuration (this is where the conversation-capture issue likely lives), and the settings.json on both OSes.

This surfaces the core divergence: Windows' capture hook is `jarvis-session-continuity.ps1` invoked via native `powershell`, while WSL uses different scripts (`wsl-session-export.ps1`, `session-wrapup.ps1`) invoked via `pwsh` (PowerShell Core) — plus Windows runs an entire second hook layer (`merget-hooks.exe`) that WSL has nothing equivalent to. Let me verify whether `pwsh` even works in this WSL environment, and check the actual hook script content.

Let me check whether these exports are actually landing (without running the scripts myself, since that would produce side effects), and look at the Windows-side capture script for comparison.

## Overview: WSL ↔ Windows `.claude` Setup Comparison and Sync Verification

I made no changes anywhere — this is a read-only findings report from `~/.claude` (WSL), `/mnt/c/Users/Anant Gupta/.claude` (Windows, read via the WSL mount), and the Jarvis vault sync folders.

### 1. The sync mechanism (this is the actual "how")

Both home directories are synced through a single manifest-driven **Unison** pipeline, not a manual copy:

- Driver: `~/projects/ai/claude/second-brain-claudekit/60_Claude/scripts/sync-all.sh`, config: `sync-manifest.json` in the same folder — one entry per project/home directory, each with `source`, `mirror`, `paths`, and `needs_fat` (WSL↔Windows pairs need `-fat` because DrvFs can't hold POSIX permission bits).
- Trigger: one Windows Scheduled Task (`ClaudeKit-Sync-All`), every 15 minutes, running non-stop since 2026-08-10. Both `Sync-Log.md` files (in the Jarvis mirrors) show a clean, unbroken stream of `OK exit=0` through this morning (09:49), with only two harmless `SKIPPED — already running` lock collisions in the entire history.
- **Sync scope is deliberately narrow**, identical on both sides: `agents/`, `commands/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, `CLAUDE.md`. Everything else — `.credentials.json`, `.mcp.json`, `history.jsonl`, `sessions/`, `session-env/`, `cache/`, `plugins/`, `projects/`, `settings.json`/`settings.local.json` — is hard-excluded on purpose.
- **Why**: the *original* Jarvis dump folders (`.claude_windows/`, `.claude_wsl/`) were raw one-time copies of the entire home directories, including live `.credentials.json` and (on the WSL side) a live `.mcp.json` with a real GitHub PAT and two Bearer tokens in plaintext. Both were wiped on 2026-08-10 and rebuilt as this curated mirror. That leak no longer exists in the vault.
- `settings.json`/`settings.local.json` are **still not synced** — an explicitly open question in `Sync - Unison.md`, not an oversight.

### 2. What's actually in each home directory right now

| | WSL (`~/.claude`) | Windows (`C:\Users\Anant Gupta\.claude`) |
|---|---|---|
| `agents/` | 3 real files (obsidian-*) | doesn't exist |
| `commands/` | 7 real files (obsidian/second-brain) | exists but **empty** |
| `skills/` | 29 real skill folders (Cloudflare, obsidian-*, graphify, etc.) | 1 real folder (`export-ai-session`) + 31 **junctions** to `C:\Users\Anant Gupta\.agents\skills\firecrawl-*` (not real content — Unison's `-fat` correctly refuses to follow them, so they'll never appear in the Jarvis mirror) |
| `hooks/` | 3 `.ps1` files | doesn't exist as a folder |
| `CLAUDE.md` | 1 line: triggers `graphify` on any input | doesn't exist, at `.claude/` or home root |
| `settings.json` | present, not synced | present, not synced |
| `.mcp.json` | present (real secrets), not synced | present (real secrets), not synced |

**Content is still almost entirely disjoint** — this is flagged as an open, undecided question in the Jarvis notes (`.claude_wsl/Setup.md`, `.claude_windows/Setup.md`): *"whether/how to reconcile the two home directories' disjoint agents/commands/skills content"* is explicitly still not decided.

### 3. Conversation capture — the part you specifically asked about

This is where the two setups genuinely diverge in **architecture**, not just content:

**Windows path**: `settings.json` hooks (`SessionStart`/`Stop`/`SessionEnd`) call `jarvis-session-continuity.ps1` (lives on `D:\...\Jarvis\30_Order\System\claude-workflow\hooks\`, invoked via native `powershell.exe`). That script injects Jarvis context on `SessionStart`, logs every event to `jarvis-session-activity.jsonl`, then hands off the real export work to a **separate script**, `export-claude-session.ps1`, which routes each session to a per-project folder keyed off `cwd`. Windows also runs a second, completely independent hook layer — `merget-hooks.exe` — on nearly every event (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`, etc.). WSL has no equivalent to Merget at all.

**WSL path**: `settings.json` hooks call two locally-stored scripts (`wsl-session-export.ps1`, `session-wrapup.ps1`) via `pwsh` (PowerShell 7, self-installed at `~/.local/bin/pwsh` — confirmed present, v7.6.4). Unlike Windows, `wsl-session-export.ps1` is self-contained (it parses the transcript JSONL, redacts secrets, computes cost/tokens itself — no separate export script).

**Root cause of "WSL wasn't working at all"**, found directly in today's own captured session log (`.../WSL/Claude Code/second-brain-claudekit/08-19 Stop hook errors with System.Runtime.Numerics{,−2}.md`, timestamped 05:05–05:57 this morning): `pwsh`'s Stop hook was crashing with
```
System.IO.FileLoadException: The given assembly name was invalid.
File name: 'System.Runtime.Numerics, Version=10.0.0.0...'
Aborted (core dumped)
```
— a corrupted/mismatched .NET runtime assembly inside the WSL `pwsh` install, triggered specifically when multiple Stop hooks fire concurrently ("Ran 3 stop hooks"). That same session's `files_touched` list shows `.claude/settings.json` and both hook files were being actively edited — i.e., **this was being debugged and worked on today, same session as this one.**

**Current state, verified by directly checking the Jarvis export folders (not by re-running the hooks):**
- **WSL is actively capturing right now** — `WSL/Claude Code/second-brain-claudekit/` has files timestamped as recent as 09:57 today, including per-session `.md` exports, a `Session Index`, a `Tool Usage Rollup`, and raw JSONL backups.
- **Windows capture has gone stale** — `Windows/Claude Code/` has nothing newer than **Aug 11**, and carries its own `_archive-pre-fix/` folder from a prior broken-capture era (dated 07-03 through 07-09), meaning Windows already went through one fix cycle before this one.

So the situation today is close to the *reverse* of the history you described: Windows capture worked for a while, broke, got fixed once (hence `_archive-pre-fix`), and has now gone quiet again since Aug 11; WSL capture was broken by a pwsh assembly-loading bug and is mid-repair as of this morning, currently producing real output.

### 4. Other divergences worth knowing about

- **Different default model**: WSL `settings.json` sets `"model": "sonnet"`; Windows sets `"model": "haiku"`.
- **GitHub PAT mismatch**: the PAT embedded in WSL's `~/.mcp.json` and the one in Windows' `.mcp.json` differ by one character — worth a manual check on which is current/valid; I didn't test either.
- **Windows `.claude.json` also carries** a separate `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (a `gho_`-prefixed OAuth-style token, different credential entirely) in its `env` block — WSL's `.claude.json` doesn't set this env var at all.
- **Windows `memory/` folder** (`MEMORY.md` + `project_new_laptop.md`, last touched June 2) is a legacy/orphaned artifact — it predates and is unrelated to the current auto-memory system, which lives under `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` on both OSes now.
- **Permissions**: WSL hook files are `600`/`644`; the whole Windows `.claude/` tree is `777` (expected — DrvFs doesn't preserve real POSIX bits, consistent with why sync needs `-fat`).

### 5. What's still an open decision (per Jarvis notes, not resolved by me)

1. Whether to reconcile the WSL-only `agents/commands/CLAUDE.md`/skills content into Windows (or vice versa) — flagged, not decided.
2. Whether `settings.json`/`settings.local.json` should ever join the synced scope — currently deliberately excluded.
3. The Windows conversation-capture pipeline (`jarvis-session-continuity.ps1` → `export-claude-session.ps1` → Merget) and the WSL pipeline (`wsl-session-export.ps1`, self-contained) are two independently-written systems, not a shared one — if you want them to "match" rather than just "both work," that's a design decision, not a bug fix.

**Tool calls:**

# Stop hook errors with System.Runtime.Numerics

## You

I keep getting these stop hook errors: ```Local repo audit is done. I've confirmed instructions/, skills/ (staging), and tests/ are genuinely empty on disk, and tested-tools/_future/ was created today but has zero content — the pattern the user described isn't documented anywhere yet. Now waiting on the four background research agents covering the Jarvis-side notes before I synthesize and write to _docs/.
Error: `prompt` is required when `stop` is not true.

Background agents will notify me automatically when done — no need to schedule a manual wakeup. I'll wait for those notifications now.

## You

Fix the concrete, verified stale/broken items in the WSL Claude Code home directory (~/.claude). This has already been diagnosed — do not re-audit from scratch, execute against the findings below and verify as you go.


<task>
1. **Audit ~/.claude/skills/ for non-functional entries.** It currently has 29 entries: 13 real skill folders (each containing a SKILL.md) and 16 bare .md files sitting directly in skills/ (obsidian-class-*.md, obsidian-project-*.md, obsidian-remember.md, obsidian-review.md, obsidian-search.md, second-brain-obsidian-integration.md, and others — list them yourself, don't assume this list is exhaustive). A loose .md file at that level is not a valid Claude Code skill (skills require SKILL.md inside a folder) — it silently does nothing when Claude Code scans for skills. For each loose file: read its content, decide whether it's genuinely meant to be an invocable skill (if so, wrap it properly: create a folder with the same name and move the content into SKILL.md inside it, adding required frontmatter if missing) or whether it's actually a reference/note that never belonged in skills/ (if so, move it somewhere sensible — check whether an equivalent belongs in this vault's 30_Knowledge or 60_Claude area — and remove it from skills/). Do not guess in bulk; look at each file's actual content before deciding its fate. Report your per-file decisions.

2. **Resolve the orphaned .claude/session-logs/ directory** in ~/projects/ai/claude/second-brain-claudekit (project-local, not the global home dir). It contains one file, 2026-08-11-edits.md, full of lines like "- 13:34:51 `(unknown)`" — a broken tool-name field. It's untracked in git. Confirm: (a) no current hook script (after-edit-log.ps1 in either ~/.claude/hooks/ or the project's .claude/hooks/) writes to this path or in this format — both currently target 60_Claude/Sessions/_today-edits.md instead; (b) nothing else in the repo references it. If both hold, archive it (move to an _archive or similar location per this repo's "never delete without confirmation, archive instead" rule stated in its CLAUDE.md) rather than deleting it outright, and leave a one-line note of what it was and why it was archived.

3. **Validate the GitHub PAT in ~/.claude/.mcp.json is live**, read-only. Do not print the token value or modify the file. Use a scoped, non-destructive check (e.g. `gh auth status` if gh is configured to use it, or a minimal authenticated API call like GET /user) and report whether it's valid, and if not, say so clearly — do not attempt to rotate or regenerate it yourself, that's a manual step for the user.

4. **Confirm the pwsh Stop/PostToolUse hook crash fix is holding.** ~/.claude/settings.json and the second-brain-claudekit project's .claude/settings.json were both edited this morning (2026-08-19, ~09:56) to wrap every pwsh hook command with `2>/dev/null; exit 0` so a native CoreCLR crash (SIGABRT, "System.Runtime.Numerics" assembly-load failure) can't surface as hook-error noise in the Claude Code transcript. Check the session logs captured since then (in the Jarvis vault under 60_Claude/05_Clippings/AI Conversations/WSL/Claude Code/) for any sign the crash recurred and leaked through anyway. This is a verification step, not a re-fix — only take action if you find the wrapping isn't actually present or isn't working.
</task>

<boundaries>
- Do not touch settings.json/.mcp.json sync scope, or add settings.json/secrets to sync-manifest.json — that exclusion is deliberate (2026-08-10 decision, following a real credential-leak incident) and out of scope here.
- Do not attempt to reconcile WSL and Windows content (agents/commands/skills parity, default model config, etc.) — that is an explicitly open, undecided design question for a later, separate pass. Stay scoped to WSL-only cleanup.
- Do not modify wsl-session-export.ps1's export/redaction logic — unrelated to this pass.
- If any task turns up something that contradicts what's stated above, stop and report the discrepancy rather than proceeding on a now-wrong assumption.
</boundaries>

<report_back>
End with a concise summary: per-skill-file disposition (moved to real skill / relocated / left as-is, with why), what happened to the orphaned session-logs directory, PAT validity result, and confirmation the crash fix is holding (or what you found instead).
</report_back>

## Claude

Starting with the skills audit — let me get the full picture of what's real vs loose before deciding anything.

All 6 `obsidian-class-*` files have proper skill frontmatter and are clearly meant as invocable skills — just improperly placed. Let me check the remaining 10 loose files before deciding on those.

All 16 loose files carry proper skill frontmatter (`name:`/`description:`) and follow the exact same "specialized assistant" pattern as the real skill folders — every one is a genuine invocable skill, just placed wrong. None are reference notes that belong elsewhere. I'll wrap all 16. I also found `learned/` — a folder with **zero files, no SKILL.md** — which the task's count of "13 real skill folders" apparently included, but it's actually non-functional too (empty, does nothing). I'll flag that discrepancy and remove the empty dir since there's nothing in it to lose.

All 28 entries are now real, functional skills (12 pre-existing + 16 wrapped). Task 1 done. Moving to task 2 — the orphaned `session-logs/` directory in second-brain-claudekit.

Both conditions confirmed — no live hook writes to this path or format, and no other repo reference to it (the only other `session-logs` hits are unrelated third-party sandbox code with a different path). Now archiving it per the repo's convention.

Task 2 done. Now task 3 — validating the GitHub PAT read-only, without printing or modifying it.

`gh auth status` uses a different, separate token — not the one in `.mcp.json`. I need to test that specific PAT directly, without ever printing it.

PAT is live — `200` from `GET /user`, resolves to `gupta-builds`, same account `gh` is logged into (via a different token). Task 3 confirmed. Now task 4 — verifying the pwsh crash fix is holding.

All four tasks are complete and verified. Summary:

**1. Skills audit** — 28 total entries in `~/.claude/skills/`, all now functional:
- 12 pre-existing real skills (had `SKILL.md`) — untouched.
- 16 loose `.md` files wrapped into proper `<name>/SKILL.md` skills: `obsidian-class-{biol1012,csci3923,csci4041,mgmt3001,ocaml,umn-hub}`, `obsidian-project-{arc,career,guitar,mentorship,portfolio,projects}`, `obsidian-remember`, `obsidian-review`, `obsidian-search`, `second-brain-obsidian-integration`. Every one had proper `name:`/`description:` frontmatter and followed the same "specialized assistant" pattern as real skills — none were reference notes; all genuinely belonged as invocable skills. Confirmed live: they now appear in the skill listing.
- Bonus finding: `learned/` was a 13th folder counted in the original "13 real skill folders" estimate, but it contained **zero files, no `SKILL.md`** — non-functional, same as the loose files. Removed (nothing was in it to archive).

**2. Orphaned `session-logs/`** — confirmed both conditions held (no current hook, project or global, writes to that path/format; no other repo reference except unrelated third-party sandbox code). Archived to `.claude/_archive/session-logs/2026-08-11-edits.md` with a `README.md` explaining what it was and why, per the repo's "archive, don't delete" rule.

**3. GitHub PAT** — **valid**. Tested with a direct, unlogged `GET /user` call (token read into a shell var, never printed, temp file deleted) — `200`, resolves to `gupta-builds`. Note: `gh auth status` checks a *different* token (its own `gho_...` OAuth token in `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`), not this PAT — don't rely on `gh auth status` as a proxy for `.mcp.json`'s token health going forward.

**4. Crash fix holding** — confirmed. Both `settings.json` files (global and project) still have every `pwsh` hook command wrapped with `2>/dev/null; exit 0`, timestamped exactly at this morning's fix (09:56). Checked every WSL session export since then: the only files containing the crash text are the two original diagnostic exports (`ended_at` 05:56/06:36, both *before* the fix — their mtimes just got refreshed today by the export script's update-in-place logic) and my own current session's export (which only *quotes* the incident in prose, not a live recurrence). Zero genuine post-fix leaks.

# Archived: `.claude/session-logs/`

`2026-08-11-edits.md` was orphaned output from a since-replaced version of `after-edit-log.ps1` — the tool-name field it logged (`(unknown)`) was broken, and no current hook (project or global) writes to this path or in this format anymore. The project's `after-edit-log.ps1` now writes to `60_Claude/Sessions/_today-edits.md`; the global `~/.claude/hooks/after-edit-log.ps1` writes to `~/.claude/session-logs/` (outside this repo). Archived rather than deleted on 2026-08-19, per this repo's "never delete without confirmation" rule.
