# Cursor setup and documentation

## You

<timestamp>Friday, Aug 28, 2026, 9:36 PM (UTC+4)</timestamp>
<user_query>
Familiarize yourself with the codebase, create a .cursor folder, write cursor's instruction documents mimicing the claude's workflow already setup (.claude, claude.md, readme.md, etc.). More details regarding the internship loop is listen in detail inside jarvis. Go through all the important documents listed out inside jarvis for this purpose in detail. Here are some folders that contain important notes: `10_Areas/Career/Internships` - main hub, `10_Areas/Career/Internships/Tracker` - tracking system, `10_Areas/Career/Engineer Edge Roadmap`, `20_Progress/Internship` - another main hub, `20_Progress/Internship/Building System` - full build (read each note here), `20_Progress/Internship/Resumes` - your work. Read everything provided and set yourself up for future tasks with cursor. The first task you will do is lay out the resume alteration and generation following official resume standards (google's - xyz method, amazon's resume template, etc.). This is just the starting task that needs to be executed. There will be many more tasks to be completed. First, go ahead and familiarize yourself with everything inside this codebase and jarvis notes created.

## Cursor

**Planning for task execution**

I need to plan since there are multiple files and instructions to create. It’s possible that no specific skill is needed, but I should check relevant documentation in the vault. Since the user mentioned familiarization first, it seems they want me to prepare before executing the task. I need to understand clearly what steps to take upfront. I might need to use my Obsidian skills, especially if they work with Jarvis.

**Evaluating implementation plan**

It seems I need to adjust my approach due to complexity. The user is asking for implementation instructions, but first, they suggested I familiarize myself with the broader context. I wonder if the execution will affect the resume; maybe it’s more about laying things out instead. I might switch gears a bit here to make sure I'm prepared to provide the best guidance possible. Let's see what I can do!

**Exploring agent options**

I need to explore agents based on the given instructions. It might be helpful to detail specific areas. I’m considering using three agents in parallel: one for a comprehensive repository, another for Jarvis intern hubs, and a third for building system roadmaps or resume tracker templates. They will likely operate in read-only mode. I should also list the root and include CLAUDE and README PRD to ensure that all necessary documentation is covered.

I’m mapping the repository conventions and the requested Jarvis hubs in parallel, including the full build-system and resume notes. I’ll use that evidence to propose a minimal, durable `.cursor` instruction structure and the first resume-workflow task before making any changes.

**Planning agent notifications**

I need to think about whether I should create my own listing or wait for notifications at the end without using any tools. It seems like we have enough agents to manage this. I could read folder documents to get more information. Once the agents return, I can plan the creation but maybe shouldn’t process that just yet. After everything’s set up, then I can proceed with notifications.

**Tool calls:**

- `ReadFile` — `{"path":"/home/anant_gupta/.claude/skills/second-brain-obsidian-integration/SKILL.md"}`
- `SwitchMode` — `{"target_mode_id":"plan","explanation":"This spans repository conventions, multiple vault hubs, and a durable Cursor workflow; I’ll map the existing system before proposing the smallest instruction set and resume workflow."}`
- `Subagent` — `{"description":"Map repository workflow","subagent_type":"explore","model":"inherit","run_in_background":true,"prompt":"Explore this repository thoroughly (medium/very thorough) for the user's request to create Cursor instruction documents modeled on the existing Claude workflow. Read README.md, PRD…`
- `Subagent` — `{"description":"Research internship vault hubs","subagent_type":"obsidian-researcher","model":"inherit","run_in_background":true,"prompt":"Read Jarvis vault notes comprehensively for this user request, without editing. Focus on every note contained in these exact folders and relevant linked standard…`

<user_query>Perform any necessary follow-up actions in response to the subagent completion above. If no follow-up work is needed, no further action is required. If you mention an agent or subagent in your response, link it with the `[Name](id)` Don't use generic label such as `[agent]`, `[worker]`, or `[subagent]`. For cloud subagents, when the agent has edited code, link to `[Review](bc-id#changes)`, or, if you know the exact added and deleted line counts, `[Review +A −D](bc-id#changes)`, replacing A and D with those counts. Never write A or D literally. Use `[Try Live](bc-id#desktop)` only when the agent used computer use. Don't repeat the same confirmation every time.</user_query>

## Cursor

The repository mapping confirms there is no existing `.cursor` setup and identifies a small, parity-focused Cursor layer. I’m waiting on the two Jarvis analyses so the plan reflects your actual internship and resume workflow rather than only the codebase.

## Cursor

Resume research found a material constraint: the vault has no official Google XYZ or Amazon resume-template source, and its existing “Google XYZ” guidance is third-party. I’ll keep employer-specific standards as sourced inputs rather than present them as official; the remaining internship-system review will determine the final instruction and resume-contract plan.
