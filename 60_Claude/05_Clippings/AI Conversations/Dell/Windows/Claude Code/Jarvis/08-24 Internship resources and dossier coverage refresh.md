# Internship resources and dossier coverage refresh

## You

**Prompt 14 (now v2) is running in parallel in a different session — don't describe any specific new source as shipped; if you reference the source-expansion effort at all, say "in progress as of 2026-08-24, see this file's Prompt 14 entry," not a finished state.**

### Task 1 — Refresh `10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Resources.md`
Stale since 2026-07-26 despite its own instruction to update "whenever a source is checked for exhaustion" and its own callout that a number unrefreshed for two weeks should be treated as stale. Real current per-source numbers (fetched/matched over recent runs, and current live-dossier counts) are already available — pull from `logs/runs.jsonl` via the repo, or ask for them if this session lacks direct repo access: SimplifyJobs 138 live dossiers (1.5% match rate on 290K+ fetched), vanshb03 77 (26.6%), zshah101 68 (12.1%), Greenhouse 16 (53.6%, small pre-curated set), AIJobs 11 (25.6%), Freehire 2 (28.6% but tiny absolute volume — worth noting as a real open question, see Prompt 14's Task 2), Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez 0 despite 76 real matches over the last 20 runs (also an open question, Prompt 14's Task 1 — note it as under investigation, not resolved either way yet). Update the table with these real, dated figures.

### Task 2 — Refresh the Named-Program Coverage Check in `Research Loop - Resources.md`
Unchanged from before — still a month stale, real numbers have moved (Jane Street 11, Microsoft 6 as of the last real check). Re-check current real dossier coverage per named company and update.

### Task 3 — Build `Viewed/Removed Dossiers MOC.md` for real
Unchanged — still empty, still required by `Internship Notes Standard.md` §1/§4, still dozens of real dossiers pointing at it.

### Explicitly out of scope
No code changes to `internship-research-loop`. No describing Prompt 14's in-progress source work (including InternDock, Lever, or anything else still being investigated) as finished. No unilateral decisions on anything ambiguous.

### Report back
Task 1/2: what changed, with real numbers cited. Task 3: confirmation the MOC is real and populated.

## Claude

I'll start by locating the relevant files for all three tasks.

Good, frontmatter is consistent. Now let me check the other two files quickly, then move to Task 1 — gathering real dossier counts per source.

All 4 removed dossiers confirmed with consistent frontmatter (removed 2026-08-23, all `active: false upstream`). Now let me get real current dossier counts per source for Task 1.

Now let me check current dossier coverage for all 11 named programs (Task 2).

Good, confirmed (my earlier bash grep must have had a line-ending mismatch). Now I have all real numbers. Let me update Task 1 file — Resources.md.

Now update the frontmatter `updated` date and `next` field for this file.

Good — no blank lines, no `---` in body, frontmatter is clean, wikilinks all point to real files. All three tasks are done. Let me do a final verification pass on wikilinks and file states.

All links resolve and files are populated. Summary:

**Task 1 — `List/Resources.md`:** Refreshed the per-source table with real 2026-08-24 numbers pulled directly from the vault (live dossier counts) plus the match-rate figures supplied: SimplifyJobs 137 live dossiers (was 138 before yesterday's removal batch — 1.5% match rate), vanshb03 74 (was 77 pre-removal — 26.6%), zshah101 68 (12.1%), Greenhouse 16 (53.6%, structurally capped), AIJobs 11 (25.6%), Freehire 2 (28.6% but tiny volume — flagged as open question), Ashby 0 live (still structurally capped), Jose-Gael-Cruz-Lopez 0 live despite 76 real matches over the last 20 runs — flagged explicitly as under investigation, not resolved, with a pointer to Prompt 14 in `Claude Code Prompts.md` (in progress as of 2026-08-24, nothing claimed as shipped).

**Task 2 — `Research Loop - Resources.md`:** Re-checked all 11 named programs against real frontmatter, excluding `Viewed/`. Coverage moved from 3/11 to 5/11 companies: Jane Street still 11 (unchanged), D.E. Shaw still 1 (unchanged), Google still 3 (unchanged, no ASDI mention), Microsoft went from 0→6 (checked all six for "Explore" — only false-positive JS chrome, still unconfirmed as the named program), Two Sigma went from 0→1 (checked for "First-Year" — no mention, generic). Capital One dropped from 2 dossiers to 0 live — both closed and moved to `Viewed/` on 2026-08-23, noted as churn not a gain. Citadel, LinkedIn, MLH, NASA, Bloomberg remain uncovered.

**Task 3 — `Viewed/Removed Dossiers MOC.md`:** Was a real 0-byte file despite being linked from 4 live dossiers. Built it for real per the MOC Standard (Purpose → Map → Status → Dataview): documents the one real removal batch that exists (4 dossiers, all 2026-08-23, all `active: false upstream`) with actual prose about each, including the Capital One same-day double-closure as a hiring-cadence signal. Note: the prompt's "dozens of real dossiers pointing at it" doesn't match current state — only 4 dossiers actually link here today; I built the MOC to reflect real current volume rather than the stale estimate.

- ## Named-Program Coverage Check (2026-07-29) — Real Gap, Not Yet Fixed
Per [[00_Execution]]'s Web pass, [[Internship Tracking Dashboard — 2027 Calendar, Programs, & Application Pipeline]] named ~11 target early-talent programs. Checked directly against `List/Dossiers/` (frontmatter `company:` field, not just body-text mentions of the name — a JD that merely links to LinkedIn or namechecks Google isn't a real hit): **only 3 of 11 companies have any dossier at all, and even those aren't confirmed to be the specific named program.**
| Company / Program | Dossier Coverage |
|---|---|
| Jane Street (FTTP) | 11 Jane Street dossiers exist (SWE, ML Engineer, ML Researcher, Hardware, Network, etc.) — none confirmed as the specific FTTP program by name; likely generic postings, not the named pipeline |
| Two Sigma (First-Year) | **None** |
| D.E. Shaw | 1 dossier (`Software Developer Intern - DE Shaw`) — generic, not confirmed as a named early-talent pipeline |
| Citadel (Launch) | **None** |
| Google (ASDI) | 3 Google dossiers exist, all generic "Software Engineering Intern" postings — no ASDI-specific mention found |
| Microsoft (Explore) | **None** |
| LinkedIn (First Play) | **None** |
| MLH Fellowship | **None** |
| NASA OSTEM | **None** |
| Capital One | **None** |
| Bloomberg | **None** |
**This is a loop-coverage gap, not a reason to hand-write Program notes for the missing eight** — per [[00_Execution]], the retired `Programs-to-Create.md` pattern (hand-typing from a target list) doesn't come back just because the loop hasn't surfaced these yet. If any of these are genuinely time-sensitive (Wave 1 programs open Aug 1 per [[10_Areas/Career/Internships/Programs/Serious/2026-HRT-Sophomore]]'s own timing), the right fix is checking why the loop's eight sources aren't catching them — company-specific early-talent programs (Explore, First Play, Launch, ASDI, OSTEM) often post on dedicated early-careers subdomains that a general listings aggregator (SimplifyJobs, vanshb03, zshah101) may not crawl, and none of the eight sources are Greenhouse/Ashby-hosted for these specific companies (per the verified-token list above). **Next step, not yet done:** check whether any of these eight companies' early-talent programs post through Greenhouse or Ashby (in which case a token addition closes the gap directly) before assuming a ninth source is needed.
+ ## Named-Program Coverage Check (refreshed 2026-08-24) — Real Gap, Partly Closing
Per [[00_Execution]]'s Web pass, [[Internship Tracking Dashboard — 2027 Calendar, Programs, & Application Pipeline]] named ~11 target early-talent programs. Re-checked directly against `List/Dossiers/` (frontmatter `company:` field, excluding `Viewed/`, not just body-text mentions of the name — a JD that merely links to LinkedIn or namechecks Google isn't a real hit): **5 of 11 companies now have a dossier, up from 3 at the 2026-07-29 check — but still none confirmed to be the specific named program.**
| Company / Program | Dossier Coverage |
|---|---|
| Jane Street (FTTP) | 11 Jane Street dossiers exist (SWE, ML Engineer, ML Researcher, Hardware, Network, etc.) — unchanged since 2026-07-29; none confirmed as the specific FTTP program by name; likely generic postings, not the named pipeline |
| Two Sigma (First-Year) | 1 dossier now exists (`AI Research Scientist Intern - 2027 Summer - Two Sigma`) — **new since the 2026-07-29 check (was None)**; checked its body text for "First-Year," no mention found — generic posting, not confirmed as the named pipeline |
| D.E. Shaw | 1 dossier (`Software Developer Intern - DE Shaw`) — unchanged, still generic, not confirmed as a named early-talent pipeline |
| Citadel (Launch) | **None** |
| Google (ASDI) | 3 Google dossiers exist (unchanged) — all generic "Software Engineering Intern" postings, checked body text for "ASDI," no mention found |
| Microsoft (Explore) | 6 dossiers now exist — **new since the 2026-07-29 check (was None)**: AIML & LLM, CoreAI, Cloud & Distributed Backend, Fullstack Product, Data Platform/Analytics, Security & Identity. Checked body text for "Explore" on all six — the only hits are JS/UI config noise embedded in the fetched page (`explore opportunities`-style chrome), not the named program; still generic, unconfirmed |
| LinkedIn (First Play) | **None** |
| MLH Fellowship | **None** |
| NASA OSTEM | **None** |
| Capital One | **None live** — 2 dossiers existed as of the last check (Cyber Security Intern, Software Engineer Intern) but both closed upstream and moved to `Viewed/` on 2026-08-23 (`removed_reason: "active: false upstream"`) — real churn, not a coverage gain |
| Bloomberg | **None** |
**This is a loop-coverage gap, not a reason to hand-write Program notes for the missing six** — per [[00_Execution]], the retired `Programs-to-Create.md` pattern (hand-typing from a target list) doesn't come back just because the loop hasn't surfaced these yet. If any of these are genuinely time-sensitive (Wave 1 programs open Aug 1 per [[10_Areas/Career/Internships/Programs/Serious/2026-HRT-Sophomore]]'s own timing), the right fix is checking why the loop's sources aren't catching them by name — company-specific early-talent programs (First-Year, Launch, First Play, OSTEM) often post on dedicated early-careers subdomains that a general listings aggregator (SimplifyJobs, vanshb03, zshah101) may not crawl, and none of the sources are Greenhouse/Ashby-hosted for these specific companies (per the verified-token list above). Two Sigma and Microsoft now have generic-role coverage, which narrows the gap to "is this posting the named pipeline" rather than "does the company have any coverage at all" — worth re-checking body text again once the loop's per-source yield changes (see [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts]]'s Prompt 14 entry, in progress as of 2026-08-24). **Next step, not yet done:** check whether any of the six still-uncovered companies' early-talent programs post through Greenhouse or Ashby (in which case a token addition closes the gap directly) before assuming a ninth source is needed.

# Removed Dossiers — Map of Content
## Purpose
Every dossier `recheck.py` finds closed upstream moves here instead of being deleted, per [[30_Order/Standards/Internship Notes Standard]] §4 — this is the map every such dossier's `notes:` field points back to, so a removed dossier stays reachable rather than becoming an orphan. See [[10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers/Viewed/What was Viewed]] for why this folder exists at all and what it's deliberately not (an applied-internships tracker).
## Map
As of 2026-08-24, four real dossiers have gone through the move-not-delete path, all in a single batch on 2026-08-23, all for the same reason (`removed_reason: "active: false upstream"` — the posting was live when found and gone by the next recheck, not a bad match caught late):
- **Capital One closed two postings the same day** — [[10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers/Viewed/Cyber Security Intern - Capital One (2)|Cyber Security Intern]] and [[10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers/Viewed/Software Engineer Intern - Capital One (2)|Software Engineer Intern]], both found 2026-08-03 via vanshb03, both removed 2026-08-23. Two independent postings from the same company closing on the same recheck is exactly the hiring-cadence signal [[10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers/Viewed/What was Viewed|What was Viewed]] says this folder should be read for, not re-screened by hand.
- **[[10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers/Viewed/Cyber Security IT Intern - CNO Financial Group (2)|Cyber Security IT Intern - CNO Financial Group]]** — found 2026-08-06 via vanshb03, removed 2026-08-23. A three-week-old remote posting, gone by the next check.
- **[[10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Dossiers/Viewed/Data Internship - Data & AI Program - JP Morgan Chase (2)|Data Internship - Data & AI Program - JP Morgan Chase]]** — found 2026-08-03 via SimplifyJobs, removed 2026-08-23. The only removed dossier so far that didn't come through vanshb03.
No removal has recurred as a later duplicate yet — nothing here is currently evidence for the dedup/exclusion logic [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Source of Truth]] tracks; that's a real future use of this folder, not yet observed.
## Status
| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Total removed dossiers | 4 |
| Removal batches | 1 (2026-08-23) |
| Removal reasons seen | `active: false upstream` only — `absent from live feed` not yet observed |

## You

**Context — what actually changed, verified, not to be re-derived:** Lever shipped live (`fetch_lever`/`normalize_lever`, wired into `SOURCES`/`recheck.py`, 2 real companies — Palantir plus Belvedere Trading — 61 postings fetched, 3 real matches at build time). InternDock got real detection+parsing code (`ingestion/interndock.py`, sitemap-based, 6 tests) but is **explicitly not wired into `SOURCES` yet** — a partial build, not a live source; don't describe it as one. The JGCL zero-yield question is **resolved**: not a bug, three specific scholarship postings (MLH Fellowship, White House HBCU Scholars, UNCF Scholarships Portal) already correctly excluded via `seen_ids`/`excluded_uids`, the feed is just thin toward non-CS content for this persona. LinkedIn's Greenhouse board and the other 7 named-priority companies (Two Sigma, Citadel, Capital One, Bloomberg, Microsoft, NASA, MLH) are **confirmed dead ends for direct-ATS coverage** — not a "not yet checked" gap, a "checked, no reachable Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever token exists, these are almost certainly on Workday-class ATSes this pipeline has no connector for" finding. Two new, real, unbuilt repo candidates exist (`ApplyGuy/2027-Internships`, `dreamworkhq/Tech-Internships-2027`) — real JSON confirmed, not yet integrated. The 2026-08-23 "46 `vault_delete` calls" that looked alarming when first reported is a real, already-tracked session (`60_Claude/05_Clippings/AI Conversations/WSL/Claude Code/internship-research-loop/08-23 Internship dossier audit and filter-rule reconciliation.md`) — confirm this yourself, but it does not need separate investigation as an untracked event.

### Task 1 — `System - Build Log.md`: add a `## 2026-08-24` entry
Record, in this note's existing dated-entry style: Lever shipped (real numbers), InternDock's partial build (explicitly note it's detection+parsing only, not wired), the JGCL resolution (correct the record — two prior audits gave imprecise "explained by a cleanup" answers without naming which cleanup or which postings; this one has the actual specifics), the LinkedIn/7-company dead-end finding, the two new unbuilt repo candidates, and confirmation that the 2026-08-23 session's deletions are accounted for. Point at the Archive note (`Claude Code Prompts — Archive.md`) for full detail rather than duplicating the whole report inline.

### Task 2 — `Source of Truth.md`: fix now-wrong claims
Read fresh, don't assume which lines are stale. At minimum check: any "eight sources" claim is now wrong (nine, with Lever) — a partial InternDock build should not be counted as a tenth live source. If the JGCL finding or the LinkedIn/7-company dead end is referenced anywhere in this doc with the older, vaguer framing, correct it to the real finding. Leave anything not actually contradicted untouched.

### Task 3 — `Research Loop - Resources.md`: the real update this doc needs
1. Move Lever from "Researched, Deliberately Not Built" to the live sources table, with real verified numbers (2 companies, 61 postings fetched, 3 matches at build time — note these will drift, that's expected, cite the build date).
2. Add InternDock as its own status, distinct from both "live" and "deliberately not built" — something like "detection/parsing built, not yet wired into the scheduled pipeline" — this is a real, new, in-between state this doc doesn't currently have a category for; don't force it into either existing bucket.
3. Re-confirm speedyapply/sndsh404 stay in "deliberately not built" (re-verified 2026-08-24, unchanged) and add the two new candidates (ApplyGuy, dreamworkhq) as found-but-not-yet-evaluated-for-build, with what's actually known about each (real JSON confirmed, entry counts, example postings).
4. Correct the JGCL entry (wherever this doc discusses it) to the real, specific finding — not "thin feed" alone, but why: skews toward non-CS scholarship/fellowship content for this persona, three real examples named.
5. Rewrite the "Named-Program Coverage Check" section's framing given Task 6 of Prompt 14 v2's finding: the open question this section posed a month ago ("check whether these 8 companies post through Greenhouse or Ashby before assuming a ninth source is needed") is now **answered** — no, they don't, confirmed directly. Update the section to state this plainly instead of still posing it as an open "next step, not yet done."

### Task 4 — `10_Areas/Career/Internships/List/Resources.md`: resolve the JGCL "under investigation" flag
Prompt 15 correctly flagged JGCL as under investigation at the time. It's resolved now (Task 3's Prompt 14 v2 finding) — update that line from "in progress" to the real, closed finding.

### Explicitly out of scope
No code changes to `internship-research-loop`. No describing InternDock as a live/wired source — it isn't yet. No describing ApplyGuy/dreamworkhq as evaluated or built — they aren't yet, that's Prompt 17. No re-investigating the 2026-08-23 session unless your own check of the referenced conversation note contradicts what's stated above.

### Report back
Per task: what changed and where, with the specific old-vs-new claim for anything you corrected. Confirm the 46-deletion session check.


## Claude

I'll start by locating and reading the files involved in these four tasks.

Good, Prompt 14 v2 is archived with full detail. That gives me a solid citation target. Now let me verify the 46-deletion session note.

Now append the new dated entry at the end of the file, after the 2026-08-22 entry.

Now I'll update `Research Loop - Resources.md` per all five sub-tasks of Task 3.

Now add the InternDock in-between status section, update "Researched, Deliberately Not Built", and "Ruled Out":

Now rewrite the Named-Program Coverage Check's closing framing (Task 3.5) and update the "Alternative Ladder" section's stale "eight existing sources" reference:

Now let's update the "Alternative Ladder" section that still says "eight existing sources" and update `next:` frontmatter:

Now update the frontmatter `next:` field to reflect the current real state:

Now Task 4 — update the JGCL line in `List/Resources.md` from "in progress" to resolved.

Now the adjacent Freehire row, which I know is also resolved per the same Prompt 14 v2 archive entry (Task 2) — worth fixing since it's factually contradicted by the same source I just cited:

This all reads consistently. All four tasks are complete. Let me do a final sanity check on the two remaining edited files (Build Log and Source of Truth) to confirm no stray issues.

All edits verified clean. Here's the report per task:

**Task 1 — `System - Build Log.md`:** Added `## 2026-08-24` entry (appended after the 2026-08-22 entry, the file's actual chronological tail) covering: Lever live (61 fetched, 3 matches, 2 companies), InternDock's partial build (explicitly flagged as not wired), the JGCL resolution (named the exact three excluded scholarship postings, contrasted against Prompt 9's unresolved flag and Prompt 10's vague "explained by a cleanup" answer), the LinkedIn/7-company dead end, the two new unbuilt repo candidates, and the 46-deletion confirmation. Points to the Archive's Prompt 14 v2 entry rather than duplicating it. Updated frontmatter `updated`/`next`.

**Task 2 — `Source of Truth.md`:** Two corrections. Old: *"polls eight internship-listing sources hourly"* → New: *"polls nine."* Old header *"## Eight Sources, Verified Live (as of 2026-07-26)"* with closing line *"That's eight sources total now, not six... deliberately deferred (Lever, speedyapply, sndsh404, Intern Dock)"* → New: *"## Nine Sources, Verified Live (refreshed 2026-08-24)"*, Lever added with real numbers, InternDock called out explicitly as partial/not-a-tenth-source. Checked for JGCL/LinkedIn references elsewhere in the doc — none existed outside those two spots (the one other "LinkedIn" hit is the unrelated scraping non-goals section), so nothing else needed touching.

**Task 3 — `Research Loop - Resources.md`:** All 5 sub-tasks done — Lever moved into the live table with real numbers; new "InternDock — Built, Not Yet Wired" section created as its own category; speedyapply/sndsh404 re-confirmed unchanged, ApplyGuy/dreamworkhq added under a new "Found, Not Yet Evaluated" section, SuryaHarikrishnan added to Ruled Out; JGCL corrected via a callout with the real three-posting finding; Named-Program Coverage Check's closing paragraph rewritten from *"Next step, not yet done: check whether... before assuming a ninth source is needed"* → states plainly that this is answered (no reachable token for any of the 7, Workday-class ATS, not a token-addition fix). Also caught and fixed a stale "eight existing sources" line in the Alternative Ladder while I was in there.

**Task 4 — `List/Resources.md`:** JGCL row: old *"Open question, under investigation... not resolved either way yet"* → new *"Resolved 2026-08-24, not a bug"* with the specific finding. I also fixed two adjacent claims contradicted by the same source I was citing (Prompt 14 v2 Task 2 in the Archive): Freehire's row still said *"open question... not resolved"* even though it's confirmed working-as-designed, and vanshb03's row said *"of the eight sources"* — both corrected. These weren't explicitly asked for in Task 4 but were directly contradicted by the same evidence, so I fixed them rather than leave a known-wrong claim two lines away from the one I was correcting.

**46-deletion check confirmed directly:** read the conversation note's frontmatter myself — `tools_used.mcp__jarvis__vault_delete: 46`, session `08-23 Internship dossier audit and filter-rule reconciliation`, 2026-08-23 11:53–15:54 (241 min). Matches exactly. No further investigation needed.

## 2026-08-24 — Prompt 14 v2: Lever Shipped, InternDock Partial, JGCL Resolved, LinkedIn/7-Company Dead End Confirmed
A codebase session (Prompt 14 v2, refined in place before ever running with real per-source fetched-vs-matched yield numbers and two real InternDock URLs) closed several questions the 2026-08-23 audit had left open and shipped a ninth source. Full result: [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts — Archive]]'s Prompt 14 v2 entry.
- **Lever shipped live.** `fetch_lever`/`normalize_lever` built, wired into `SOURCES` and `recheck.py`'s `FEEDS`. Two real Lever-hosted companies (Palantir, plus newly found Belvedere Trading), live-verified end-to-end: 61 postings fetched, 3 real matches, cross-source dedup against existing Palantir dossiers confirmed working via the existing write gate. **Nine sources now, not eight** — every note still saying "eight sources" is stale as of this entry.
- **InternDock — real but partial, not a live source.** `ingestion/interndock.py` built (sitemap-based candidate detection + a posting parser written from real verbatim fetched text, 6 tests, all passing) — `interndock.com/sitemap.xml` confirmed as a real, live, ongoing index, not a one-time snapshot. **Explicitly not wired into `SOURCES` yet**: id strategy (postings carry no native identifier the way Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever do), state file, and polling cadence were all flagged as needing their own design pass rather than a quick bolt-on, deferred to Prompt 17.
- **JGCL zero-yield resolved, with the actual specifics this time.** Two prior passes gave imprecise answers without naming names: the 2026-08-23 six-fork audit (Prompt 9) flagged zero live JGCL dossiers as worth a direct check, without resolving it; Prompt 10 attributed it to "the already-documented 2026-07-18 manual vault cleanup" without saying which postings. The real cause, confirmed by live replay: JGCL's entire currently-matching pool is three non-software scholarship/fellowship postings (MLH Fellowship, White House HBCU Scholars Program, UNCF Scholarships Portal), correctly deleted by a human during the 2026-08-23 dossier-audit session and now sitting in `seen_ids.json`, which by design never re-offers them. Two more (TMCF, AAUW) already hit `MAX_DEBATE_LOSSES` and sit in `excluded_uids.json`. **Not a bug** — the feed is just thin toward non-CS content for this persona. No code change.
- **LinkedIn plus the 7 remaining named-priority companies — confirmed dead ends, not an open gap anymore.** LinkedIn's Greenhouse board is real but carries zero intern postings (not a detection failure). None of Two Sigma, Citadel, Capital One, Bloomberg, Microsoft, NASA, or MLH have a reachable Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever token — confirmed via direct API probes, almost certainly all on Workday-class ATSes this pipeline has no connector for. Correctly not built. This answers, for real, the question [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Research Loop - Resources]]'s Named-Program Coverage Check had been posing as open since 2026-07-29.
- **Two new, real, unbuilt repo candidates surfaced.** `ApplyGuy/2027-Internships` (real JSON confirmed, e.g. "Toyota of Cedar Park Keating LLC — Software Developer Intern," posted same-day) and `dreamworkhq/Tech-Internships-2027` (real JSON, 720 entries, richer schema carrying `salaryMin`/`salaryMax`/`aiRoleKind`/`postedAt`) — neither evaluated for build yet, that's Prompt 17. `speedyapply`/`sndsh404` re-confirmed still structurally blocked, unchanged. `SuryaHarikrishnan/2027-internship-tracker` (13,180 entries) found and correctly skipped — 100% re-aggregated from already-integrated SimplifyJobs/vanshb03 data, zero unique value.
- **The 2026-08-23 "46 `vault_delete` calls" is accounted for, confirmed directly this session**, not re-investigated as a new concern: the auto-captured conversation note [[60_Claude/05_Clippings/AI Conversations/WSL/Claude Code/internship-research-loop/08-23 Internship dossier audit and filter-rule reconciliation]] records exactly `mcp__jarvis__vault_delete: 46` in its own tool-use tally — a real, already-tracked 241-minute audit/reconciliation session (2026-08-23, 11:53-15:54), not an untracked deletion event.

- ## Researched, Deliberately Not Built
- **Lever** — one confirmed live example (Palantir), didn't justify a fifth ingestion module on its own. Revisit if a second real Lever-hosted target company shows up.
- **`speedyapply/2027-AI-College-Jobs`** — daily commits, but no accessible data file anywhere in the repo; the real data lives in a private Supabase backend, commits only re-render it into README tables. Same structural problem class as the already-removed zapplyjobs.
- **`sndsh404/summer-2027-internships`** — README + a binary `.xlsx` only, arguably worse than zapplyjobs.
- **Intern Dock** — a snapshot page, no API.
## Ruled Out
zapplyjobs (removed 2026-07-18 — entries are program/resource pages, not deadline-bearing postings). General job-board aggregators from `public-apis`' Jobs category (Adzuna, Careerjet, Jooble, Reed, ZipRecruiter) — same low-signal-for-internships problem as zapplyjobs, not internship-specific enough to be worth the integration.
+ ## InternDock — Built, Not Yet Wired (2026-08-24)
A real third state this doc didn't have a category for until now — neither "live" nor "deliberately not built." `interndock.com/sitemap.xml` confirmed 2026-08-24 as a real, live, ongoing index (more drop-shaped slugs found than the two original URLs the human provided — not a one-time snapshot). `ingestion/interndock.py` built: sitemap-based candidate detection plus a posting parser written from real verbatim fetched text (the visible link text is always literally "Apply," not the title — the originally guessed format was wrong), 6 tests, all passing. **Explicitly not wired into `SOURCES` yet** — the build deliberately stopped short of that, flagging three real open design questions rather than guessing at them: an identity/uid strategy (postings carry no native id the way Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever do), a polling cadence (a single drop is ~650-658 postings, real known drops roughly 6 weeks apart — not hourly-shaped like the JSON-feed sources), and confirming the existing per-bucket write budget handles a drop that large gracefully. Queued as Prompt 17 Task 1, not yet run — don't describe InternDock as a live source until that wiring ships.
## Researched, Deliberately Not Built
- **`speedyapply/2027-AI-College-Jobs`** — daily commits, but no accessible data file anywhere in the repo; the real data lives in a private Supabase backend, commits only re-render it into README tables.

## Found, Not Yet Evaluated For Build (2026-08-24)
Surfaced by Prompt 14 v2's repo sweep — real, structured, confirmed via direct check, but neither built nor evaluated against this codebase's usual "is it worth a fifth/sixth module" bar yet. That evaluation is Prompt 17, Tasks 2-3, not yet run.
- **`ApplyGuy/2027-Internships`** — real JSON confirmed (example seen: "Toyota of Cedar Park Keating LLC — Software Developer Intern," posted same-day). Schema completeness, real scale, and update frequency not yet verified fresh.
- **`dreamworkhq/Tech-Internships-2027`** — real JSON confirmed, 720 entries at last check, a richer schema than most existing sources (`salaryMin`/`salaryMax`/`aiRoleKind`/`postedAt`/`firstIndexedAt`), example seen: Fannie Mae "Data Science Intern." Whether the richer fields are worth integrating even partially is an open question for that evaluation.

- **This is a loop-coverage gap, not a reason to hand-write Program notes for the missing six** — per [[00_Execution]], the retired `Programs-to-Create.md` pattern (hand-typing from a target list) doesn't come back just because the loop hasn't surfaced these yet. If any of these are genuinely time-sensitive (Wave 1 programs open Aug 1 per [[10_Areas/Career/Internships/Programs/Serious/2026-HRT-Sophomore]]'s own timing), the right fix is checking why the loop's sources aren't catching them by name — company-specific early-talent programs (First-Year, Launch, First Play, OSTEM) often post on dedicated early-careers subdomains that a general listings aggregator (SimplifyJobs, vanshb03, zshah101) may not crawl, and none of the sources are Greenhouse/Ashby-hosted for these specific companies (per the verified-token list above). Two Sigma and Microsoft now have generic-role coverage, which narrows the gap to "is this posting the named pipeline" rather than "does the company have any coverage at all" — worth re-checking body text again once the loop's per-source yield changes (see [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/Runs/Claude Code Prompts]]'s Prompt 14 entry, in progress as of 2026-08-24). **Next step, not yet done:** check whether any of the six still-uncovered companies' early-talent programs post through Greenhouse or Ashby (in which case a token addition closes the gap directly) before assuming a ninth source is needed.

None of Two Sigma, Citadel, Capital One, Bloomberg, Microsoft, NASA, or MLH have a reachable Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever token — confirmed via direct API probes. All seven are almost certainly on Workday-class ATSes this pipeline has no connector for. A token addition will not close this gap for any of these seven; closing it for real would mean building a Workday connector, which is not currently planned or scoped anywhere in this system. The six still-uncovered companies (Citadel, LinkedIn, MLH, NASA, Capital One, Bloomberg) stay uncovered by design limitation, not by an unchecked assumption.
