# Portfolio frontend UI fixes implementation

## You

I wish to implement ui fixes listed out over here in detail: `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/frontend`, `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/frontend/claude-code-setup`. There are tons of things already listed out in these notes, there as previous ui build run which was completed asnd moved to the ran folder, do not nmeed to go through those noptes. But rest each amd everything needs to be reviewed in massive detail. We are about build through the ui one by one running the smartest models to implement these ui fixs, so we need to be detailed and correct. I am going to provide images for cursor to first enhace through all the notes that arer created. So, we crerate the exact ui desired and the most perfect ui effect based on the new skillsets that were applied such as liquid glass and GSAP. There are tons of more things that i wish to fix about the ui. I want you to write a prompt for the model gpt 5.5 on plan mode to reall dig through the images provided and notes written down insider jarvis. Go through it in so much detaiol to have complete context regarding fixing it, before anythjing is mentioned to you already about the fixes - go through everything already listed out. I am going top provide you with the most human experience of the existing localhosted server. All the chnages that were already made will be discussed in detail in that human narration after the plan has gone through each and everything that has been mentioned right now. After that, I want it to go through some official resources on how to use gsap and animated effects for the about carousel that i wish to design - gather rich content on how exact to build smooth scroll transition effects. First, provide me with a prompt so that gpt 5.5 goes through everything mentioned in massive detail.

## Claude

I'll start by exploring the actual notes in your vault so the prompt I write references real content instead of generic placeholders.

I read through everything at both vault paths — `BUILD-STATUS.md`, `UI Fixes.md` (the raw dictated transcript + 7 screenshot embeds), the four `claude-prompt-ui-fixes-*` meta-prompts, the `frontend-ui-fixes-{requirements,design,tasks}.md` trio, and all 6 files under `claude-code-setup/` — to map how they relate before writing the prompt. Quick finding worth knowing before you paste this in: `claude-code-setup/*` and `Ran/*` are actually the **same generation** (the completed build + its R0–R8 polish pass, dated June 2026) — `claude-code-setup` is the *tooling* for the `Ran` notes, not new content. The genuinely open, unreviewed material is `UI Fixes.md` (July 2026 dictation) and everything it spawned: `frontend-ui-fixes-{requirements,design,tasks}.md` plus the four audit/implementation prompts. I built the prompt below around that distinction so GPT‑5.5 doesn't waste its pass re-deriving fixes that already shipped.

```
ROLE & MODE
You are doing deep context-gathering only — Plan Mode, zero code edits, zero file writes.
This is Phase 1 of a 3-phase engagement. Do not propose implementation, do not touch any
component, do not run codemods. Your only output for this phase is a written synthesis.
Stop at the end of Phase 1 and wait for me — I will then give you a live human narration
of testing localhost, and only after that do you move to Phase 3.

REPO CONTEXT
Next.js 16 App Router portfolio, Tailwind v4 (CSS-first, no tailwind.config), shadcn/Radix,
Framer Motion, React Three Fiber + drei, Sanity CMS, Clerk, Biome (not ESLint), pnpm.
Current branch already has "liquid glass" and GSAP added as new UI capabilities — the
working tree has extensive uncommitted changes across nearly every section component.
Treat every note below as a claim about a PAST state of the code, not a guarantee about
the CURRENT state. Verify claims against the live files before trusting them.

SOURCE OF TRUTH — READ IN THIS ORDER
All paths are relative to the Obsidian vault folder `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/frontend/`.

Do NOT open or use anything under `frontend/Ran/` (17 files, `00` through `16`) as a source
of open work — that is the prior build round, already implemented and shipped. Likewise treat
`frontend/claude-code-setup/` (files 00–05: subagents, commands/hooks/CSP, R0–R8 phase prompts,
deploy checklist, Orby polish) as tooling/process documentation for that SAME completed round —
read it once for background (what subagents/commands already exist: frontend-builder,
three-artist, sanity-schema, security-reviewer, test-runner; commands: build-fix, deploy, e2e,
performance, review, sanity-push, typecheck) so you don't reinvent them, and specifically check
whether the CSP header item it flags as "non-optional" actually shipped — but do not extract new
fix requirements from it.

The OPEN, unreviewed material — read every one of these in full, not just headings:
1. `UI Fixes.md` — the raw dictated ground truth (July 2026) plus 7 embedded screenshots
   (`Pasted image ...` embeds). This is the actual voice of what's wanted; everything else is
   a derivative. Look at every embedded image side-by-side with the paragraph it sits near —
   do not skip images because the surrounding prose seems to cover it.
2. `claude-prompt-ui-fixes-analysis.md` — the prompt that turned #1 into a
   requirements/design/tasks split. Read it to understand the methodology, not for fix content.
3. `frontend-ui-fixes-requirements.md`, `frontend-ui-fixes-design.md`, `frontend-ui-fixes-tasks.md`
   — the current formalized fix spec (Fix Areas 0–8 plus 7b; Tasks 0.1–5.5). Treat this trio as
   the most authoritative WRITTEN spec of what's wanted, but not as proof of what's BUILT.
4. `claude-prompt-ui-fixes-audit-pass.md` and `[REDACTED].md` — two later
   verification passes that each cross-checked the trio above against the live repo and the
   screenshots, and each found real gaps (deploy-sync verification missing entirely; education
   deformity sequencing present in the transcript but absent from the docs; chat bubble text
   overflow; skills category chip effects under-specified). Read these for the corrections they
   already made — do not silently drop those corrections in your own synthesis.
5. `claude-prompt-ui-fixes-implementation.md` — the six-prompt phase-by-phase execution script
   (Phase 0–5) written to actually build the trio's spec. Read it to see exactly what was supposed
   to be executed against the codebase, which tells you where to look first for "is this actually
   done now."
6. `BUILD-STATUS.md` — has a stale TL;DR table explicitly marked wrong by its own correction
   banner ("do not trust the status table"). Ignore that table. Its `## UI Fixes` numbered list
   (1–14) is a DIFFERENT, EARLIER feedback round than `UI Fixes.md` — read it only to confirm it
   is fully superseded by the Ran/claude-code-setup round, not as open work.

YOUR VERIFICATION STANDARD
Match the rigor `pass-3.md` set for itself: every claim you make about current code state must
be checked by actually opening the named component file and line, not inferred from the notes.
Where a note says a field/behavior/file doesn't exist or isn't wired up, grep for it yourself —
liquid glass and GSAP were added after most of these notes were written, so several "not done"
or "not started" claims may now be partially or fully true, wrong, or superseded. Where a note
references a Sanity field or query, check `src/sanity/schemaTypes/` and `src/lib/sanity.queries.ts`
(or wherever queries live now) directly.

PHASE 1 DELIVERABLE — "Master UI Fix Ledger"
Produce one consolidated, de-duplicated ledger, one row per distinct fix, with:
- Fix name/short description
- Source note(s) it came from (file + section)
- Current implementation status, VERIFIED against the live repo: done / partially done /
  not done / superseded / contradicted by a later note — with the exact file(s):line(s) you
  checked
- Any contradiction between notes (e.g., where the audit passes corrected the trio) and which
  version you're treating as current
- Open questions you cannot resolve from notes + code alone

Group the ledger by area (Hero/Background, About, Telemetry boxes, Portfolio Lab chat, Experience,
Projects carousel, Skills, Education flowchart, Certifications, Achievements, Blog, Contact,
Footer, Orby, Dark mode, CSP/a11y/deploy-sync) so it's scannable.

End Phase 1 by presenting this ledger and explicitly stating you are stopping here and waiting
for my live narration. Do not guess at or pre-empt what I'll say in that narration.

PHASE 2 (triggered by my next message, not by you)
I will narrate my actual hands-on experience testing the current localhost build — what's
visibly working, what's broken, what looks different from these notes now that liquid glass/GSAP
exist, and new feedback that isn't in any note yet. Treat this narration as the newest and
highest-priority ground truth. Reconcile it against the Phase 1 ledger explicitly: for each thing
I say, tell me whether it confirms, contradicts, or adds to a ledger row. Update the ledger.

PHASE 3 (only after Phase 2 is reconciled — do not jump ahead)
I want to rebuild the About section as a carousel using GSAP-driven smooth-scroll transitions,
composited with the liquid-glass surfaces already in the design system. Before proposing any
implementation, go research GSAP's official documentation directly (gsap.com docs, ScrollTrigger,
ScrollSmoother/Observer as applicable, official CodePen demos) — do not rely on memorized/training
knowledge, GSAP's licensing and plugin availability changed (Webflow acquisition) and APIs move.
Gather concrete, current guidance on: scroll-triggered timelines vs. scroll-snap, pinning sections,
smooth-scroll implementations that coexist with a Three.js/R3F canvas background and backdrop-filter
glass surfaces (performance implications), and reduced-motion fallbacks. Cite what you find. Only
then produce a concrete animation architecture proposal for the About carousel — still no code yet,
that's a separate follow-up once I approve the approach.

CONSTRAINTS THAT APPLY TO EVERY PHASE
Respect this repo's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` rules throughout your reasoning: Tailwind v4 is CSS-first
(no tailwind.config.ts), App Router only (no src/pages), Biome not ESLint, all content comes from
Sanity (never hardcode), pnpm only, and the `.cosmic-card`/`.float-btn` visual contracts already
defined in `globals.css`. Flag anywhere a note's request would conflict with these before Phase 3
proposes anything.
```

A couple of things worth deciding before you send this: whether you want GPT‑5.5 to run this against the repo directly (it has file access via Cursor) or purely from the vault notes — the prompt assumes direct repo access since that's what the verification standard requires.

**Tool calls:**

## You

Now another session inside cursor to have a very detailed plan about the orby, deployment ready checks, securitymeasuers and rate limiting fixes that need to be done to the portfolio. We note all these down inside jarvis excellently in another cursor session too. For everything that I am talking about refer to the existing notes already laid out side the portfolio folder(`20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio`). There are tons of thigs that need our attention - seo and AEO as well. Actuall, you are going to provide me with two prompts over here now. Both opf these sessions are going to write well structurted notes insidfe jarvis. One of them is going to be focus on searching SEO and AEO content strategies - how exactly do we make sure that our website domain is rendered on google and other platforms? We want it to be suggested as the best portfolio, ai agent, lab, ai chatbot, pet, screenings, etc. There are tons of things that need to be taken care in detail so that we complete our seo and aeo journey. One entire session just dedicated for this reseach and writing notes process is required. I might have a few inbgestions listed about these builds already such as: `20_Progress/Projects/AI Use/Builds & Resources/Code Review & Eval Gap`, `60_Claude/20_Distilled_Notes/Sources - Plan/_Notes Created From Ingestion`. We need strong things structured and well laid out from the ingestion discussion that was done for portfolio things. Write two prompts for two sessions to write notes into jarvis after asking a lot of questions and making sure that everything is laid out perfectly.

## Claude

Both `security/` and `AEO & SEO/` folders already exist under `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio` with real prior work — this isn't a blank-slate research task, it's a reconciliation task. Two things worth flagging directly before the prompts:

- **The model-provider chain is documented four different, contradictory ways** across the vault: `chatbot/02-model-router.md` (graphify snapshot) says Gemini→Groq; `nextgen-chatbot/05` says Azure GPT-4o-mini→Cerebras→Groq→Mistral→degraded; `security/README.md` (the most recently *code-verified* one, June 15) says Cerebras→Groq→Mistral→degraded with **no Azure at all**; and `Problems with Portfolio Lab.md` separately complains backup providers "never fire" and mentions a Z.ai GLM 4.7 leg nobody else mentions. Your own recent commits (`ci: switch eval provider to Cerebras — Mistral key unauthorized`) confirm Mistral is currently broken. This needs a real read of the live router file, not another note.
- **`security/README.md`'s two pre-launch blockers** (CSP still Report-Only, `/api/health` still Clerk-gated) are dated June 15 — three months ago — and match a CSP gap `frontend/BUILD-STATUS.md` also flagged. Worth checking if either shipped since.

Both prompts below tell the session to verify these against live code before writing anything, and both end with an explicit instruction to ask you clarifying questions before finalizing notes.

**PROMPT 1 — Orby, Deployment Readiness, Security & Rate Limiting**

```
ROLE & MODE
Deep research + vault-documentation session. Cursor, this repo (gupta-builds/Portfolio).
Your deliverable is well-structured Obsidian notes written into the Jarvis vault — NOT code
changes. Do not edit any application source file. You may read the repo freely to verify claims.

WHY THIS SESSION EXISTS
Three security/reliability planning passes happened in this vault in June 2026 (security/,
nextgen-chatbot/, and a graphify auto-generated codebase snapshot). None have been reconciled
against each other or against the live repo since, and it's now three months later. This session's
job is to produce ONE current, verified ground-truth record of: Orby's actual reliability posture,
what's actually deployment-ready, what security work actually landed, and what rate
limiting/abuse controls actually exist — then get my sign-off on open decisions before writing it.

READ IN THIS ORDER — vault paths relative to `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/`

1. `security/README.md` — the master index, last verified against code 2026-06-15. States two
   launch blockers: CSP still Report-Only (not enforced), `/api/health` still Clerk-gated (blocks
   uptime monitoring). Then read `security/phase-1-auth-clerk.md` through `phase-5-monitoring.md`
   in order, then `security/claude-code-prompts.md` and `security/manual-actions.md` (what was
   supposed to get executed, split between Claude Code and manual dashboard steps).

2. `nextgen-chatbot/08 - Build Phases & Milestones.md` — the master tracker (status: sprout),
   Phase 0 through Phase 8 ("Launch readiness") with a coverage table. Read this as the entry
   point for Orby's overall build state.
3. `nextgen-chatbot/00 - Nextgen Chatbot — Build Plan.md` and
   `nextgen-chatbot/02 - Premortem & Failure Defenses.md` — 10 ranked failure modes (worst:
   "it lied about me to a recruiter") plus a "Defense coverage check". Only failures 2, 5, 6 are
   confirmed addressed elsewhere in the notes — verify the rest (1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10) against
   current code yourself.
4. `nextgen-chatbot/05 - Model Layer, Rate Limiting & Abuse.md` — the "finalized" plan (2026-06-14):
   Azure OpenAI GPT-4o-mini primary (Azure for Students credit) → Cerebras → Groq → Mistral →
   degraded, plus the budget-tiering, caching, and origin-locking design. Treat the Azure leg as
   UNVERIFIED — see the contradiction note below.
5. `nextgen-chatbot/09 - Orby Fixes.md` and `nextgen-chatbot/Problems with Portfolio Lab.md` —
   the fix log and a distilled root-cause note (raw JSON leaking to the user, Orby not speaking,
   backup providers never firing, a first-prompt-specific bug, Cloudflare Turnstile errors, and a
   Z.ai GLM 4.7 issue nothing else in the vault mentions). Verify which of these are actually fixed.
6. `nextgen-chatbot/10 - Orby Golden Eval Dataset (Grounding Cases).md` and
   `claude-code setup/04 - Eval Harness — promptfoo.md` — the eval gate design ("the real quality
   gate" + a CI gate section). Cross-check against recent git log: recent commits show the eval
   gate being switched to Cerebras and made advisory/continue-on-error because the Mistral key is
   unauthorized. Confirm this is still true and explain what it means for the "real quality gate."

7. GRAPHIFY SNAPSHOT — READ FOR ORIENTATION ONLY, TRUST NOTHING SPECIFIC:
   `chatbot/*`, `architecture/*`, `components/*`, `data/*`, `communities/*`, `INDEX.md`,
   `god-nodes.md`, `GRAPH_REPORT.md` are all auto-generated by graphify from one old commit
   (`89cd2c0e`, ~2026-06-12). `chatbot/02-model-router.md` alone already contradicts two later
   notes (it says Gemini→Groq, nobody else does) — proof this snapshot is stale. Use it only to
   find file paths quickly, then verify everything against current HEAD.
8. `claude-code setup/00 - Claude Code Build Kit — Index.md` through `05 - Per-Phase Build
   Prompts.md` — background on the subagents/commands/hooks already set up for this chatbot build.
   Don't duplicate what already exists (`ai-engineer`, `eval-runner` agents; `/eval`, `/deploy`,
   `/ship-check`, `/security-review` commands are visible in this session's own skill list).

9. INGESTION SOURCES — these three files are huge and cover the user's entire vault, not just
   the portfolio. Search/grep for the specific sections named below rather than reading wholesale:
   - `60_Claude/20_Distilled_Notes/Sources - Plan/PDF's Ingestion Implementation.md` — find the
     "Code Review & Eval Gap: Pre-Commit AI Backstop - BUILD" and "Orby (Portfolio): Model
     Regression Detection for Eval - BUILD" sections.
   - `20_Progress/Projects/AI Use/Builds & Resources/Code Review & Eval Gap.md` — read in full
     (short). Documents the decision: Semgrep (permanent static-analysis layer, free) +
     `/simplify` + `/code-review` as a standing habit (not a new tool) + promptfoo, not deepeval,
     for output validation. Verify Semgrep is actually wired into CI/pre-commit in this repo.
   - `60_Claude/20_Distilled_Notes/Sources - Plan/00_Execution.md` — search for the resolved
     verdicts on the two topics above.

THE CONTRADICTION YOU MUST RESOLVE BEFORE WRITING ANYTHING
Four different documented model-provider chains exist across these notes (listed above). Read
the actual router file in `src/lib/` (name may have changed — grep for it) and the actual env var
names in use, plus recent `git log` on this branch, to determine: what is the REAL current
provider chain, is Azure OpenAI wired in at all, and what exactly is broken with the Mistral key
right now (recent commits reference this as a live, unresolved issue).

WHAT TO VERIFY, SYSTEMATICALLY
- Every phase in `security/README.md`'s Phase Map (1–5): still true, or changed since June 15?
- Both named launch blockers (CSP enforcement, `/api/health` auth): fixed or still open?
- Every premortem failure mode (1–10) in note 02: has a real defense in code, or still exposed?
- The rate limiting numbers themselves (burst/day caps, HMAC token TTL, origin allowlist) —
  confirm against the live code, not any single note (they disagree slightly across notes).
- Whether the promptfoo CI gate is currently blocking or advisory, and why.
- Out of scope for you: Orby's visual/animation polish (radio antenna, walking, ground-anchoring,
  idle AI commentary) is being handled in a separate frontend UI session from `frontend/UI Fixes.md`
  — note its existence if relevant but don't duplicate that work here.

BEFORE WRITING THE FINAL NOTE — ASK ME QUESTIONS
Do not guess on anything that's a real decision rather than a code fact. At minimum, surface:
- Is the Azure for Students credit still active/wanted, or should that leg be dropped from the plan
  entirely since the live code doesn't have it?
- Should the promptfoo eval gate be made blocking again once the Mistral key is fixed, or stay
  advisory long-term?
- `AEO & SEO/00 - Agent-Ready Infrastructure Build Plan.md` has a deferred "Agent-Callable Orby
  via MCP" idea that explicitly says it "needs a real security-model conversation first" before
  becoming a real phase — a parallel session is researching the AEO case for this. Do you want to
  make a real go/no-go call on it now, or leave it deferred?
- Is Vercel WAF Attack Challenge Mode actually turned on?
- What's the real production domain, for the origin allowlist check?

DELIVERABLE
A new, dated, clearly-current note (propose a name/location to me before writing, e.g. a
`nextgen-chatbot/11 -` or a new dated section in `security/README.md`) that: states, per item
above, done / partially done / not done / contradicted-by-live-code with the exact file:line you
checked; gives a prioritized "must-do before public launch" list; and explicitly reconciles the
four-way model-chain contradiction into one true statement. Follow this vault's existing
conventions (frontmatter `type/status/created/updated/tags`, `[[wikilink]]` cross-references,
an `## Evidence` section citing what you verified). Do not delete or archive any existing note —
supersede with a clear correction banner, the way `frontend/BUILD-STATUS.md` already does.
```

**PROMPT 2 — SEO & AEO Discoverability Strategy**

```
ROLE & MODE
Research + vault-documentation session. Cursor. Your deliverable is a well-structured Obsidian
note (or set of notes) written into the Jarvis vault — not code. You may read the portfolio repo
to verify what's actually shipped, but do not edit application source.

already exists (created 2026-07-29) with a real 5-phase plan (metadata exports, sitemap.ts/
robots.ts, OpenGraph/Twitter tags, a privacy policy page, then an AEO audit) plus a deferred
"Agent-Callable Orby via MCP" idea. This is not a green-field research task — it's "verify what
of that plan actually shipped in the ~5 weeks since, then go much deeper" on both classic SEO and
the newer AEO (answer-engine optimization) side, specifically aimed at the site being surfaced
and recommended — by Google AND by AI assistants a person might ask — as the best portfolio,
best AI agent/lab project, best AI chatbot demo, and (the more unusual angles) as a memorable
"AI pet/companion" (Orby) and as a legitimate recruiter-screening tool.

READ IN THIS ORDER

1. `AEO & SEO/00 - Agent-Ready Infrastructure Build Plan.md` — full read (you likely already
   have the gist, but read it directly for exact wording). Note its "Market Context" stats
   (agents are 51% of traffic, AI Overviews cutting publisher traffic 25%) — verify these are
   still the best available figures or find more current ones; this data ages fast.
2. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/architecture/01-nextjs-routes.md` — WARNING: this is a
   graphify auto-generated snapshot from an old commit (~2026-06-12), already stale by the time
   AEO/00 was written in July. Do not trust its "zero metadata exports" claim — check
   `src/app/` directly, right now, for `metadata`/`generateMetadata`, `sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`,
   and OpenGraph tags. The repo has had extensive uncommitted work recently; some of Phase 1–4
   may already be done.
3. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/chatbot/01-api-route.md` — the existing Orby endpoint the
   deferred "Agent-Callable Orby" idea would extend.
4. In `60_Claude/20_Distilled_Notes/Sources - Plan/Web Ingestion Implementation.md` — this file
   is huge and covers the user's entire vault, not just the portfolio. Find and read only the
   "Agent-Ready Infrastructure (AEO + MCP) - BUILD" section — the original proposal AEO/00 was
   built from.
5. In `60_Claude/20_Distilled_Notes/Sources - Plan/00_Execution.md` — search for the resolved
   verdict on that same Agent-Ready Infrastructure item.
6. `60_Claude/05_Clippings/Web/Security/App Privacy Policy Generator.md` — the tool AEO/00's
   Phase 4 already picked; confirm it's still the right call before citing it again.

CROSS-SESSION BOUNDARY
A parallel Cursor session is reconciling Orby's security/rate-limiting posture and will make any
real go/no-go call on exposing "Agent-Callable Orby via MCP" — that involves a real security-model
change (a machine-callable endpoint is a different threat model than a rate-limited chat widget).
Your job here is to document the AEO *case* for it (why it would help discoverability, what
official patterns exist for it) and flag the dependency — not to decide or implement it.

NEW RESEARCH TO DO — go find current, official-source information; SEO/AEO practice and platform
crawler behavior change fast enough that pre-training knowledge is not reliable here. Cite sources.

- Technical SEO for a Next.js personal portfolio: structured data (schema.org `Person`,
  `ProfilePage`, `SoftwareApplication` for the projects, `FAQPage` for Orby-answerable questions),
  canonical URLs, Google Search Console + Bing Webmaster Tools verification and sitemap
  submission, and how much Core Web Vitals actually weighs into ranking today.
- AEO / getting cited by AI answer engines specifically: the `llms.txt` convention, what
  ChatGPT/Perplexity/Google AI Overviews/Claude actually look for structurally, crawler
  user-agents to explicitly allow in `robots.ts` (GPTBot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot, Google-Extended,
  etc.), and writing page copy as directly-extractable factual sentences rather than marketing copy.
- Realistic backlink/domain-authority moves for a solo student portfolio — no paid SEO services.
  Check what's already available in this vault before inventing generic advice: GitHub README
  cross-links, `10_Areas/Career/Hackathon/Hackathons.md` (devpost/hackathon project listings),
  and any dev.to/Hashnode/LinkedIn presence already documented elsewhere in the vault.
- Specifically research how to build toward each of these positioning/query angles — treat them
  as content and structured-data targets, not literal keywords to stuff: "best portfolio site,"
  "AI agent portfolio," "AI lab," "AI chatbot" (Orby as the concrete proof), "AI pet/companion"
  (Orby's character angle — unusual but worth researching how mascot/character AI products get
  discovered and shared), and "recruiter screening tool" (positioning Orby as something a
  recruiter can actually interrogate about the candidate).
- Current best practice for exposing an MCP server or agent-callable API from a personal site
  (for the deferred Agent-Callable Orby idea) — document what you find; do not decide on it.

BEFORE WRITING THE FINAL NOTE — ASK ME QUESTIONS
At minimum: what is the real production domain; is Google Search Console / Bing Webmaster /
any analytics already set up (and if so, what does current traffic/impression data already show —
that would change the whole strategy from "starting cold" to "optimizing"); do you want a real
decision surfaced on the Agent-Callable-Orby idea or should it stay explicitly deferred here too;
which of the positioning angles (best portfolio / AI agent / AI lab / AI chatbot / AI pet /
screening tool) matters most to prioritize first; and whether any paid or semi-paid moves (a
custom domain if not already owned, a Product Hunt style launch) are actually in scope or off
the table for a solo student project.

DELIVERABLE
Extend the `AEO & SEO/` folder with a new note (propose the exact filename to me, e.g.
`01 - SEO & AEO Discoverability Strategy.md`) containing: a verified status check of AEO/00's
Phases 1–4 against live code; a structured-data spec (concrete JSON-LD to add, not just "add
structured data"); a crawler/robots.ts checklist; a content strategy mapped to each positioning
angle above; and a phased action plan that picks up from AEO/00's Phase 5 onward. Cite every
external claim with its source. Follow this vault's existing note conventions (frontmatter,
`[[wikilinks]]`, an `## Evidence` section) and cross-link back to `AEO & SEO/00` rather than
duplicating it.

## You

You are picking up a portfolio-hardening effort already in progress. This session's job is NOT to write a broad strategy document — two of those already exist and are the problem, not the solution. Your job is to produce exactly two narrow, singular-topic, execution-ready IMPLEMENTATION PROMPTS — the kind Cursor can paste in and build from in one sitting — not more strategy.

## Project

`hub/portfolio` — Next.js 16 App Router, Tailwind v4, Sanity CMS, Clerk auth, GSAP/R3F, an AI chat agent named Orby (Portfolio Lab). Repo at the working directory. Persistent notes live in an Obsidian vault reachable via the `mcp__jarvis__*` tools, rooted at `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/`.

## What already exists — read ALL of this before touching anything

Three Cursor background-agent plan files (on disk, not in the vault) describe what Cursor already built and why — read them for Cursor's own stated scope and reasoning:
- `/home/anant_gupta/.cursor/plans/[REDACTED].plan.md`
- `/home/anant_gupta/.cursor/plans/seo_aeo_note_92a02281.plan.md`
- `/home/anant_gupta/.cursor/plans/[REDACTED].plan.md`

A prior Claude Code session then verified and deepened the notes those plans produced. Read these, in this order:

1. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/nextgen-chatbot/11 - Orby Security & Reliability Ground Truth - 2026-09-05.md` — line-cited repo verification of the security/reliability posture (Clerk, CSP, rate limits, provider chain, promptfoo eval gate).
2. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/nextgen-chatbot/12 - Orby Hardening Implementation Guide - 2026-09-05.md` — the P0/P1/P2 "how," a per-provider runbook, an OWASP LLM Top 10 cross-reference, and a capacity-reality-check on rate limits. **Read the "P0-0" section closely — Cerebras's free tier changed in August 2026 and the provider chain's whole premise may need re-checking; do not assume it's already resolved.**
3. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/security/README.md` and the five `phase-1-auth-clerk.md` through `phase-5-monitoring.md` files in that same folder.
4. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/AEO & SEO/00 - Agent-Ready Infrastructure Build Plan.md` and `01 - SEO & AEO Discoverability Strategy.md` (the latter now includes a "Ranking #1 for 'Anant Gupta'" section and a portfolio-award-directory table added by a research pass — read those too).
5. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/frontend/frontend-ui-fixes-requirements.md` — for context on what "the build progresses from UI fixes to Orby" actually means sequence-wise; you don't need to touch anything in `frontend/`, it was handled separately.

Do not treat any of the above as wrong by default — they were built through actual live-repo verification, not guesses. But do not treat them as gospel either: verify anything you cite against the live repo yourself before putting it in a prompt Cursor will act on. The prior session found real hallucinated symbols and false claims in an earlier draft of the UI notes (functions that didn't exist, bugs that didn't reproduce in code, an "open question" that got silently resolved wrong) — grep and read the actual files before writing anything that names a file, function, or line number.

## The actual problem

Notes 11, 12, and 01 are comprehensive but wide — each covers many phases and angles at once. That's valuable as a reference, but it's not something Cursor can execute cleanly in one pass, and it's not narrow enough to guarantee the "massive results, singular topic" outcome the user wants. You are building two things that don't exist yet: a focused SEO→AEO execution prompt, and a focused security-hardening execution prompt — each as tight and unambiguous as `frontend/[REDACTED].md`'s "Implementation prompt" section (read that file for the bar to hit: front-loaded context, literal numbered tasks, explicit do-nots, a concrete self-verification checklist, zero ambiguity about what "done" looks like).

## Methodology — no shortcuts, this order, per topic

For EACH of the two topics below, in this exact order:
1. **Read** every vault note and repo file relevant to that topic (lists below are a floor, not a ceiling — follow the trail).
2. **Verify** every concrete claim you intend to reuse against the live repo — grep for the symbol, read the actual line, confirm the file exists at that path. Do not carry forward a citation you haven't personally re-checked.
3. **Research externally** (WebSearch/WebFetch) only for what notes 11/12/01 have NOT already answered well — they already did real research with citations; don't waste time re-deriving what's already sourced, but do chase anything stale, missing, or specific to the two narrow angles below that the broad notes didn't drill into.
4. **Only then write** the one focused implementation prompt for that topic, as a new vault note.

Do topic B (Security) fully — research through written prompt — before starting topic A (SEO/AEO). Reasoning: the SEO note already documents that Agent-Callable Orby via MCP is gated on a security session's sign-off, and the "professional proofing" trust bar the security work sets (grounding, refusal, no hallucination) is a precondition for confidently telling the world to look at this site via SEO/AEO — do the foundation first. If your own research surfaces a reason to reverse this order, say so explicitly and justify it, don't silently reorder.

Do not edit any application source file in either phase. Read-only against the repo, write-only to the vault. Neither deliverable should run `pnpm` commands, call any AI provider, or expose env values.

---

## Topic B — Security Hardening Bridge (do this one first)

Scope, in the user's own framing: as the build moves from UI fixes to Orby being fully wired, the security layer needs to go from "thin" to "tightened," specifically across:

- **Clerk authentication** — is Studio access the only thing gated, and is that actually enough? Re-verify `src/proxy.ts` and `src/app/studio/**` against note 11's claims.
- **Orby's own evolution as a security surface** — the tool-call quality gate (note 12 P0-1), the "AI-use policy" (make this concrete: what are Orby's actual refusal rules, persona guardrails, and output-sanitization behavior today, and where would a determined prompt-injection attempt still get through? Note 11 flags `/api/orby-comment` as unauthenticated — is that still true, and is that the only gap?).
- **Sanity safety net** — the user's own words were "no one can change information." Map this precisely: note 11/12 flag `SANITY_API_TOKEN` being passed as a `browserToken` in `src/sanity/lib/live.ts` and says it must be Viewer-scoped (read-only) in the Sanity dashboard. Verify current token scope is checkable (it may require a dashboard check the user has to do, similar to the Cerebras billing check in note 12 — if so, write it as an explicit numbered verification step, not a code TODO). Confirm there is no live mutation path from the public app.
- **Cloudflare-level protection — resolve an ambiguity, don't assume.** The user asked for "a literal firewall that prevents hackers" on Cloudflare specifically. `src/lib/request-guards.ts` references a Cloudflare host allowlist and reads `cf-connecting-ip`. Before writing anything about "Cloudflare WAF rules," determine whether Cloudflare is actually the edge/proxy in front of `anantgupta.dev` (check DNS/nameservers for the domain, ask the user if dashboard access isn't available to you) or whether the app is only opportunistically reading Cloudflare-shaped headers while Vercel is the real edge — in which case the actionable firewall is Vercel's own WAF / Attack Challenge Mode (already flagged as dashboard-unverified in notes 11/12), and the prompt should say so plainly rather than writing Cloudflare-specific rules for infrastructure that may not exist. If Cloudflare genuinely is in front, research concrete WAF rule recommendations (rate-limiting rules, bot-fight mode, managed rulesets) suited to a Next.js/Vercel origin behind Cloudflare.
- **Rate-limit protections, "perfected."** Note 12 already did the capacity math (Groq's 1,000 req/day is shared, not per-IP) and flagged Upstash fail-open as an unresolved P2. Turn "perfected" into concrete: should fail-open become fail-closed (or a capped fail-open) on Upstash outage, and what's the tradeoff for a portfolio (availability vs. abuse risk during a Redis outage)? Give a recommendation with reasoning, not just the question.
- **AI-use policy as a written artifact.** Beyond code guardrails, is there (or should there be) an actual short published policy — what Orby will/won't do, what data it uses, how it's grounded — that ties into the still-unshipped `/privacy` page from the SEO note's Phase 4? If these two gaps (AI-use policy, privacy page) are actually the same missing artifact, say so and don't spec them twice.

Also re-verify note 12's P0-0 (Cerebras billing) is either resolved or still the literal first action item — do not let a stale "TODO" survive into your new prompt if the user has already handled it; if you can't tell, ask.

**Deliverable:** a new note, likely `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/security/[next number] - Security Hardening Implementation Prompt - [date].md` (or wherever fits the existing `security/` numbering best — use your judgment, follow the folder's existing convention, don't invent a new structure). It should read as ONE cohesive, orderable task list a coding agent can execute — Clerk, Sanity token scope, Cloudflare/Vercel WAF (resolved, not hedged), rate-limit fail-open decision, Orby's AI-use policy and quality gate — with the Sonnet-5-tuned implementation-prompt rigor described above. Cross-link back to notes 11 and 12 as background, don't duplicate their verified-status tables.

---

## Topic A — SEO Fundamentals → AEO Evolution (do this second)

The existing note 01 is a good strategy document but is explicitly phased 5A through 5E across five different concerns at once. The user wants ONE narrow, sequenced execution prompt: ship the SEO basics first, then evolve into AEO — not a menu of options.

Re-read note 01's "Current Status" table (what's shipped vs. not: `metadataBase`, `sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`, `/privacy`, structured data — all currently missing per that table) and its "Ranking #1 for 'Anant Gupta'" section (real SERP competition findings — the bare name has high-authority competition from unrelated people; "Anant Gupta portfolio/developer/UMN" is the realistic near-term win) and its award-directory table (Siteinspire/Godly/Bestfolios/Show HN recommended now, Awwwards/CSS Design Awards held for later). Re-verify against the live repo that these are still accurate (things may have shipped since).

**Deliverable:** a new note, likely `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/AEO & SEO/02 - SEO to AEO Implementation Prompt - [date].md`, structured as a strict sequence:
1. **SEO basics, in build order** — the concrete, smallest-diff path to ship `metadataBase`, canonical URL, `sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`, the `/privacy` page (note the dependency on Topic B's AI-use-policy content if that's the same artifact), and JSON-LD structured data (Person/ProfilePage/WebSite/SoftwareApplication — note 01 already drafted these blocks, verify and reuse rather than re-deriving).
2. **Then AEO evolution** — only once the basics are real: the AI-crawler robots policy (note 01's OAI-SearchBot/PerplexityBot/ClaudeBot table), llms.txt, and the entity-building/award-directory moves — sequenced as "do this only after step 1 ships," not in parallel with it.

Same rigor as Topic B: Sonnet-5-tuned, literal, numbered, self-verifying, cross-linked to notsrc/`, `next.config.ts`, everything under the app repo. Write-only to the Jarvis vault.
- Do not silently resolve an open question you find in existing notes (e.g., anything still marked "open" or "unverified") — either verify it against the repo/dashboard yourself and say what you found, or surface it back to the user as a decision, the way prior open questions in this effort were handled (Projects auto-play scope, the logo/favicon glow claim) — don't guess.
- Don't re-litigate locked decisions you find in the existing notes (e.g., Product Hunt and paid backlink vendors are already explicitly out of scope per note 01; Agent-Callable Orby via MCP is already explicitly deferred) — respect them.
- When you hit a genuine judgment call only the user can make, use it — don't stall, don't guess silently either.
- Follow the Claude Sonnet 5 prompting guide (https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/[REDACTED]) for both output prompts: front-load full context in one turn, be literal about scope, give a concrete self-verification checklist, don't leave "make it better" vagueness where a concrete spec is possible.

Report back when both notes are written: what you verified vs. what had drifted since notes 11/12/01 were written, and any decision you had to kick back to the user.

## Claude

Content looks solid on review. Publishing it to the vault now.

Both notes saved cleanly with valid frontmatter and headings. Here's the report:

**Order followed:** Topic B (security) fully researched and written before Topic A (SEO/AEO) started, per the priority reasoning you gave.

**What I verified myself vs. what had drifted since notes 11/12/01:**
- Notes 11 and 12 held up well — I independently re-read `model-router.ts`, `chat/route.ts`, `orby-comment/route.ts`, `sanity/lib/live.ts`, `proxy.ts`, `next.config.ts`, and `eval-gate.yml` in full, and every load-bearing claim checked out.
- One real correction: note 12 frames the Cerebras tool-leak fix as "reuse Groq's exact mechanism," but that mechanism relies on Groq's SDK surfacing an error in the pre-stream response object — Cerebras's failure only exists in the streamed text, so that specific approach would be a no-op. The actual fix (in the note now) extends the stream-level `finish` handler and the sanitizer's existing generic leak-detection, which is a smaller and more accurate diff.
- I resolved the Cloudflare ambiguity you flagged with a live `curl -I https://anantgupta.dev`: both a real `cf-ray` and a real Vercel `x-vercel-id` came back on the same response — Cloudflare is genuinely in front of Vercel, not just header-shaped code. `security/cloudflare-strategy.md` already has concrete WAF rules for this (neither note 11 nor 12 had read that file) — Task 5 verifies deployment rather than re-designing rules.
- For SEO: note 01's status table was accurate — root layout has zero metadata export, portfolio layout has partial metadata, nothing else (sitemap/robots/privacy/JSON-LD) exists. I also caught that note 01's `Person` JSON-LD used placeholder field names; I corrected it to the real Sanity query shape (`PROFILE_QUERY`'s actual `socialLinks`/`email` fields).

**Decisions kicked back to you** (written into both notes, not guessed):
- Whether to check Cerebras's billing/credit status (dashboard-only, gates nothing else in the security prompt)
- Whether to fold blocking-eval-gate/Semgrep into this round or keep them separate (they're already spec'd in note 12 but weren't in your six-bullet scope)
- Sanity token scope, Sanity CORS list, and Cloudflare WAF deployment status — all dashboard-only unknowns
- Whether to block `GPTBot`/`ClaudeBot`/`Google-Extended` training crawlers or allow them (real tradeoff, not defaulted)

- `security/06 - Security Hardening Implementation Prompt - 2026-09-05.md`
- `AEO & SEO/02 - SEO to AEO Implementation Prompt - 2026-09-05.md` (Task 3 explicitly depends on the security note's Task 7 output for the privacy page's AI-disclosure content)

description: One-command pre-deploy gate — chains typecheck → build → eval → security review. All steps must pass.
---

# /ship-check

Run every step in order. **Stop on the first failure.** Fix it before re-running.

## Step 1 — TypeScript + Build

```bash
pnpm typegen      # sync Sanity schema → types
pnpm typecheck    # TypeScript strict — zero errors
pnpm lint         # Biome — fix with pnpm format then re-check
pnpm build        # full Next.js production build
```

If build fails → run `/build-fix` then retry this step.

## Step 2 — Eval Suite

Run `/eval` (delegates to `eval-runner` agent).

All promptfoo cases must pass. If any fail: stop, surface the failure, do not continue to Step 3.

## Step 3 — Security Review

Invoke the `security-reviewer` agent:
```
Use security-reviewer agent to review the diff
```

Must output **SHIP** before proceeding. It checks:
- No secrets or tokens in changed files
- No `NEXT_PUBLIC_` on server-only keys
- Clerk middleware covers all protected routes
- Sanity token scoped correctly
- Security headers present

## Step 4 — Ready to Deploy

If all three steps pass, run `/deploy` to push to Vercel production.

## Rules

- Never skip a step, even if "nothing changed" in that area
- Fix failures at the step they surface — don't patch downstream and hope
- `/ship-check` is the gate before every production push; `/deploy` handles the actual commit + push
  ```
- `Bash` — `cat .claude/commands/deploy.md 2>/dev/null || find . -iname "deploy.md"`
  ```
---
description: Full pre-deploy quality gate + security review + Vercel production push
---

# /deploy

Run every step in order. Stop on any failure and fix it before continuing.

## Step 1 — Quality Gate

```bash
pnpm typegen        # sync Sanity schema → src/sanity/types/index.ts
pnpm typecheck      # TypeScript strict — zero errors
pnpm lint           # Biome — fix with pnpm format then re-check
pnpm build          # full Next.js production build
pnpm test           # Vitest — zero failures
```

If `pnpm build` fails → `/build-fix` before retrying.

## Step 2 — Security Review

Invoke the `security-reviewer` agent before touching git:
```
Use security-reviewer agent to review the diff
```

The agent runs grep checks for secrets, NEXT_PUBLIC_ audit, Clerk coverage, Sanity token scope, and security headers. Must output **SHIP** before proceeding to Step 3.

For deep OWASP scan on large diffs also run: `/code-review`

## Step 3 — Staged Changes Review

```bash
git status
git diff --staged
```

Verify: no `.env.local`, no secrets, no unrelated files, no `console.log`.

## Step 4 — Commit

Stage selectively (never `git add .`):
```bash
git add -p
```

Ask for commit message in conventional commit format:
- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `perf:` — performance improvement
- `refactor:` — refactoring
- `chore:` — tooling/config
- `style:` — UI/visual only

Commit message must be under 72 chars, describe the WHY.

## Step 5 — Push + Monitor

```bash
git push origin main
```

This triggers Vercel auto-deploy. Monitor via Vercel MCP:
```
Use mcp__claude_ai_Vercel__list_deployments to check deploy status
Use mcp__claude_ai_Vercel__get_deployment_build_logs if build fails
Use mcp__claude_ai_Vercel__get_runtime_logs for runtime errors
```

Deploy typically takes 60–120 seconds. Report the production URL when complete.

## Rules

- Never skip Steps 1–2
- Never commit `.env.local`, secrets, or API tokens
- ECC hooks auto-block `--no-verify` — don't try to bypass them
- If Vercel build fails but local build passes: check env var names in Vercel dashboard

# Security Hardening Implementation Prompt — 2026-09-05

> **One narrow, execution-ready task.** Notes 11 and 12 are the wide reference (verified-status tables, external research, OWASP cross-reference) — this note does not repeat them. This note picks exactly six things out of them (plus one dashboard gate they share) that the user named as the current "security layer thin → tightened" bridge, re-verifies each personally against live code/live DNS one more time, resolves the one open ambiguity (Cloudflare), and turns the result into a single implementation prompt Cursor can execute in one sitting. Read notes 11/12 for background; read this note to actually do the work.

## Re-verification pass (2026-09-05, this session)

Everything below was independently re-checked against the live repo/live domain in this session, not carried forward from notes 11/12 unread:

- **Provider chain, budget tiering, cooldown mechanics** — confirmed against `src/lib/model-router.ts` directly (full file read). Matches note 11 exactly: `Cerebras zai-glm-4.7 → Groq llama-3.3-70b-versatile → Mistral mistral-small-latest → degraded`.
- **CSP enforced, `/api/health` public, Clerk scoped to `/studio(.*)` only** — confirmed against `next.config.ts`, `src/proxy.ts`, and a live `curl -I https://anantgupta.dev` (see below). Matches note 11.
- **`/api/orby-comment` has no HMAC/Turnstile gate** — confirmed by reading the full route file: it has `BLOCKED_UA`, `isAllowedOrigin`, and a 3/60s per-IP Upstash limiter, but no `chat-token` verification. Matches note 11/12.
- **`SANITY_API_TOKEN` is used as both `serverToken` and `browserToken`** — confirmed in `src/sanity/lib/live.ts:8-14`. Matches note 11/12.
- **`eval-gate.yml` is advisory (`continue-on-error: true`)**, uses `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` — confirmed. No Semgrep config anywhere in the repo (grep empty). Matches note 11/12. **Both restoring the blocking eval gate and wiring Semgrep are already fully specified in note 12 (P0-2, P1) and are deliberately NOT duplicated in this prompt — out of scope here, see "Explicitly out of scope" below.**
- **Cloudflare is genuinely the live edge, not just header-shaped code** — resolved by live `curl -I https://anantgupta.dev`:
  ```
  server: cloudflare
  cf-ray: a3632b3c8b1f4ca0-MSP
  cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC
  x-vercel-id: cle1::iad1::rpzpc-...
  x-vercel-cache: MISS
  ```
  Both a real Cloudflare ray ID *and* a real Vercel deployment ID are present on the same response — this is Cloudflare (orange-cloud proxy) sitting in front of Vercel, exactly as [[security/cloudflare-strategy]] designed it, not `request-guards.ts` opportunistically reading headers that don't mean anything. **The ambiguity the user asked to resolve is resolved: Cloudflare is real infrastructure here, and concrete WAF rules for it already exist** (see Task 5).
- **The Cerebras leak fix is NOT "reuse Groq's exact mechanism" as note 12 frames it** — corrected below in Task 2. Groq's provider-level check in `model-router.ts` inspects `JSON.stringify(response)` *before* streaming starts, which only works because Groq's SDK surfaces `tool_use_failed` as response metadata. Cerebras's failure (the model narrates a tool call as plain text instead of invoking it) does not exist yet at that point — it only appears once the stream's text content arrives, which is too late to swap providers for *this* turn. The real, already-half-built mechanism to extend is in `chat/route.ts`'s stream `finish` handler and `sanitizeChatText()` (see Task 2) — smaller diff, and provably matches what the code actually does today.

---

## What this prompt covers (and what it deliberately doesn't)

**In scope:** Clerk re-verification, the Cerebras tool-leak cooldown fix, HMAC-gating `/api/orby-comment`, the Sanity token/CORS/mutation-path check, the Cloudflare WAF verification (resolved, not designed from scratch), the Upstash fail-open logging upgrade, and the AI-use-policy content spec (handed off to the SEO/AEO prompt's privacy-page task, not built here).

**Explicitly out of scope (tracked elsewhere, do not duplicate):**
- Restoring blocking `eval-gate.yml` CI and wiring Semgrep — fully specified in [[nextgen-chatbot/12 - Orby Hardening Implementation Guide - 2026-09-05]] P0-2 and P1. Separate task.
- Reordering or adding a 4th provider leg — gated on the Cerebras billing dashboard check (P0-0 below), and out of scope for this specific ask regardless.
- Building the actual `/privacy` page — that's `[[AEO & SEO/02 - SEO to AEO Implementation Prompt - 2026-09-05]]` Task 4. This note only supplies the AI-specific content that page must include.
- Orby visual/animation polish — separate frontend session (`frontend/UI Fixes.md`).

## Implementation prompt

> Written for a single autonomous coding session (Claude Sonnet 5 in Cursor). Context is front-loaded; no follow-up turn should be needed to clarify scope. Some tasks are dashboard-only verification, not code — they are written as explicit numbered steps to report back on, not as code TODOs.

```
REPO: hub/portfolio — Next.js 16 App Router, Clerk auth, Sanity CMS, an AI chat
agent (Orby / Portfolio Lab) behind Cerebras → Groq → Mistral → degraded mode,
Upstash Redis for rate limiting, Cloudflare (proxied DNS) in front of Vercel.

READ-ONLY constraint: do not run pnpm commands, do not call any AI provider,
do not print or log any env var VALUE (names are fine). Only touch the files
named in each task below. Do not touch frontend/UI components.

Do these seven tasks in order. Each is independently scoped — do not let a
finding in one task change your approach to another unless a task explicitly
says so.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 0 — Cerebras billing status (manual check, non-blocking for Tasks 1-6)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Cerebras's no-card free tier reportedly ended in August 2026; new accounts
now get a one-time $5 credit expiring 30 days after a payment method is
added. This project's Cerebras key may predate that change and be
grandfathered, or may not be.

Ask the human operator to check https://cloud.cerebras.ai (Billing/Usage tab)
for the account tied to the live CEREBRAS_API_KEY, and report back: (a) is a
payment method on file, (b) credit balance and expiry if on the trial, (c)
which pricing tier the account is actually on. Do not guess or assume an
answer. This does not block Tasks 1-6 below (none of them depend on Cerebras
staying primary) — it only matters for a future decision about reordering
PROVIDER_CHAIN, which is explicitly not part of this task.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 1 — Re-verify Clerk/Studio auth boundary (verify only, no code change
expected)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Read src/proxy.ts in full. Confirm:
- The only protected route matcher is `/studio(.*)` via `createRouteMatcher`.
- `/api/health`, `/api/error-report`, and `/api/chat` are excluded from both
  matcher patterns in `export const config`.
- `src/app/studio/layout.tsx` and `src/app/studio/page.tsx` do not have a
  second, conflicting auth check that could either double-protect or
  accidentally bypass the proxy-level guard.

Report exactly what you find. If it matches the above (it did on
2026-09-05), make NO code change — this task exists to catch drift, not to
force a change. If it does NOT match, stop and report the discrepancy before
touching anything; this is an auth boundary, not a place to guess a fix.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 2 — Cerebras tool-call leak: set a real cooldown, don't just clean text
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
File: src/app/api/chat/route.ts (the stream `finish` handler, look for the
existing `// Groq tool_use_failed detection (in-stream)` comment and the
`sanitizeChatText(accText)` call a few lines below it).

CONTEXT — verified, not guessed: sanitizeChatText() (src/lib/chat-sanitizer.ts)
already generically strips leaked tool-call JSON from ANY provider's output
via several regexes (`{"tool":...}`, `{"function":...}`, `{"name":
"navigate"|...}`, etc.) and returns `cleanText` plus `extractedSectionId` when
it successfully reconstructs a navigation intent from leaked text. This
already partially handles the Cerebras leak for the CURRENT turn. What is
missing: when sanitizeChatText actually found and stripped something
(`sanitized.cleanText !== accText`), nothing tells the router this provider
just had a soft failure — so on the visitor's VERY NEXT message, Cerebras is
tried again with the same odds of leaking again. There is no cooldown set.

Do NOT attempt to detect the leak before streaming starts and swap providers
mid-turn — Cerebras's failure only exists in the streamed text, not in the
pre-stream response object (that's why Groq's `JSON.stringify(response)`
metadata check in model-router.ts doesn't transfer here; it relies on Groq's
SDK surfacing an error field that Cerebras's generic OpenAI-compatible client
does not have for this failure mode). Reusing that specific mechanism here
would be a no-op, not a fix — do not do it.

THE FIX: immediately after the existing `const sanitized =
sanitizeChatText(accText);` line, if `sanitized.cleanText !== accText` (i.e.
the sanitizer actually found and stripped leaked tool-call JSON) AND
`routeResult.provider !== "groq"` (Groq already has its own harder failure
path a few lines above — don't double-handle it), set the same cooldown key
the router already uses: `chat:cooldown:${routeResult.provider}` in Upstash,
TTL 30s, via the same Redis client pattern already used in
src/lib/model-router.ts (`redis.set(cooldownKey, "1", { ex: 30 })`) — you'll
need to either import/instantiate Redis the same way route.ts already does
elsewhere in this file, or export a small helper from model-router.ts and
import it (whichever is the smaller diff given what's already imported in
route.ts — check before deciding). Emit a structured log line matching this
file's existing convention: `console.log(JSON.stringify({ event:
"chat.tool_leak.cooldown_set", provider: routeResult.provider, sessionId
}))`.

Do not change the existing Groq hard-fail block above it. Do not change
sanitizeChatText's regexes. Do not change what gets sent to the client for
this turn — the sanitizer's existing cleanup/synthetic-navigate behavior for
the CURRENT turn is unchanged; this task only makes the NEXT turn route
around a provider that just leaked.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 3 — HMAC-gate /api/orby-comment
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
File: src/app/api/orby-comment/route.ts

This route currently checks BLOCKED_UA, isAllowedOrigin, and a 3-req/60s
Upstash limiter, but never verifies the HMAC session cookie that
/api/chat requires. It still calls routeChat() (the same Cerebras → Groq →
Mistral chain), so an unauthenticated caller can consume real provider quota
today.

Find the exact HMAC verification helper /api/chat/route.ts uses (it reads a
signed httpOnly cookie issued by /api/chat-token — check
src/lib/chat-token.ts for the verify function's exact name and signature).
Import and call that same helper in orby-comment/route.ts's POST handler,
positioned after the UA/origin checks and before the rate limiter (cheapest
checks first, matching the existing order in this file). On missing/invalid
token, return the same 401 shape /api/chat already returns for this case —
do not invent a different response shape for what is the same failure mode.

Do not build a second token-issuance mechanism. Do not change
/api/chat-token/route.ts. Do not change the existing UA/origin/rate-limit
checks already in orby-comment/route.ts — this task only adds one more gate
to the existing chain.

VERIFY:
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/orby-comment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000"
Before this fix: 200. After this fix: 401 (matching the documented
/api/chat behavior in security/manual-actions.md's Phase 3 curl check).

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 4 — Sanity safety net: one code check, two dashboard checks
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4a (code, verify-only): grep the entire src/ tree (excluding anything under
src/app/studio/**, which is expected to have Studio's own write path) for
Sanity mutation calls: `.create(`, `.createOrReplace(`, `.createIfNotExists(`,
`.patch(`, `.delete(`, `.mutate(`, `client.transaction(`. Report every match
with file:line. Note 11 claims zero mutation calls exist in the Next.js
layer outside Studio — confirm or refute this with the actual grep output,
don't just restate the claim.

4b (dashboard, manual — report back, do not guess): ask the human operator to
open https://www.sanity.io/manage → project → API → Tokens, find the token
set as SANITY_API_TOKEN, and confirm its Permissions column reads exactly
"Viewer". This token is passed as BOTH serverToken and browserToken in
src/sanity/lib/live.ts, meaning it is shipped to the browser via the Live
Content API's SSE connection — if it is anything more permissive than
Viewer, that is a real write-capable token exposed client-side. If it is not
Viewer, do not attempt to fix this from code; report it and stop, this is a
dashboard-only remediation (rotate the token in Sanity, per
security/manual-actions.md 2A).

4c (dashboard, manual — report back): ask the human operator to open the
same project's API → CORS Origins list and confirm it contains only known
origins (localhost:3000, the production domain, any preview domains
actually in use) with no wildcard `*` entry.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 5 — Cloudflare WAF: verify deployment, don't redesign rules
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Cloudflare is confirmed live in front of this domain (verified via
`curl -I https://<production domain>` showing both a `cf-ray` header and a
Vercel `x-vercel-id` header on the same response — Cloudflare is proxying to
Vercel, not a phantom). Concrete WAF rules for this exact setup already exist
in the vault (security/cloudflare-strategy.md Part 2, security/manual-actions.md
6D) — this task is a DEPLOYMENT verification, not a rule-design task.

Ask the human operator to open the Cloudflare dashboard for this domain →
Security → WAF and confirm, reporting back exactly what's found for each:
1. Custom Rule blocking scanner user-agents (sqlmap, nikto, nmap, masscan,
   zgrab, nuclei) — deployed and active?
2. Custom Rule blocking empty User-Agent on `/api/*` paths — deployed and
   active?
3. Rate Limiting Rule on the chat API path (~20 req/60s per IP, block
   action) — deployed and active?
4. SSL/TLS mode set to "Full (strict)", not "Full" or "Flexible"?

If any of these four are missing, the exact rule text to paste in is already
written in security/cloudflare-strategy.md "Part 2 — WAF rules" and
security/manual-actions.md section 6D — do not write new rule expressions,
copy those verbatim. Do not attempt to configure Cloudflare via API/Terraform
in this session — this is a dashboard-only task, report status and let the
human operator apply anything missing.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 6 — Upstash fail-open: keep the behavior, upgrade the observability
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
File: src/app/api/chat/route.ts, the catch block around the rate-limit calls
containing: `console.warn("[chat] Upstash unreachable — rate limiting
skipped", err);`

DECISION (already made, do not re-litigate): keep fail-open. On a Redis
outage, letting the chat endpoint keep serving (rather than 500ing every
visitor) is the right tradeoff for a portfolio site — the provider chain's
own per-provider rate limits are a second layer that still caps runaway
cost even with Upstash down, and a Redis blip is rarer than "recruiter mid-
conversation gets a hard error." Do not change this to fail-closed.

THE ACTUAL GAP: this is a plain console.warn with no structured `event`
field, unlike every other log line in this file and in model-router.ts
(which all use `console.log(JSON.stringify({ event: "...", ... }))`). That
makes a live Upstash outage invisible to any log-based alerting that filters
on the `event` field. Change this one line to match the file's existing
structured-logging convention: `console.log(JSON.stringify({ event:
"chat.ratelimit.fail_open", ip }))` — keep it as a genuine log (not an
error/throw), keep the exact same fail-open control flow, just make the
event structured and include the client IP (already computed earlier in
this function via getClientIp). Do the identical thing to the equivalent
line in src/app/api/orby-comment/route.ts if one exists there too — check,
don't assume.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 7 — AI-use policy: content spec only, no page to build here
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Do NOT create a /privacy route or any new page in this task — that page is
built by a separate SEO/AEO implementation prompt. Your job here is to
produce a short, factual list of what that page's AI-specific section must
disclose, based on what Orby's code actually does (verify each line against
the router/tools/context files named, don't invent boilerplate):

- Orby only answers using a fixed catalog fetched from Sanity CMS per
  request (src/lib/chat-context.ts) — it does not browse the web or access
  data outside that catalog.
- Orby's available actions are a fixed, closed set of tools (name them —
  check src/lib/chat-tools.ts for the real current list) — it cannot take
  arbitrary actions on the visitor's behalf.
- Messages are routed to third-party model providers in this order: Cerebras,
  then Groq, then Mistral, falling back to pre-written responses if all are
  unavailable (verify this is still the live order in model-router.ts before
  writing it down). State plainly, without hedging or omission, whether any
  of these providers' free tiers may log or use submitted prompts (check
  each provider's current published terms — do not assume a policy that was
  true when [[nextgen-chatbot/05 - Model Layer, Rate Limiting & Abuse]] was
  written in June 2026 is still current; verify freshly).
- Whether conversation history persists beyond the active browser session
  (verify: does anything write chat messages to a database, or does state
  live only in the client + a short-TTL Redis session counter?).
- That a bot-check (Cloudflare Turnstile) runs before a chat session token
  is issued, and why (abuse prevention, not tracking).

Output this as a plain markdown list appended to THIS note (not a new file,
not a new route) under a new "## AI-Use Policy Content (for /privacy)"
heading, so the SEO/AEO prompt's privacy-page task can paste it in directly.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
FINAL REPORT
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For each of Tasks 0-7, state: what you found, what you changed (file:line)
or explicitly did not change, and for every dashboard-only item, the exact
question the human operator still needs to answer. Run `pnpm typecheck` on
any file you touched (Tasks 2, 3, 6 only) and paste the output — do not run
`pnpm build`, `pnpm dev`, or anything that would call a live provider. Do not
commit or push anything.
```

## AI-Use Policy Content (for `/privacy`)

*(Placeholder — Task 7 above is written to be executed by the coding agent
that runs this prompt, which will verify the current tool list/provider
terms/session-persistence facts against live code and fill this section in
before handing off to [[AEO & SEO/02 - SEO to AEO Implementation Prompt - 2026-09-05]]'s privacy-page task. Do not treat this section as populated until that run completes — the SEO/AEO prompt's Task 4 should re-check whether this heading has real content before writing the page, and ask the user if it's still empty.)*

---

## Decisions kicked back to the user

1. **Cerebras billing status (Task 0)** — cannot be checked from the repo; needs a dashboard login. Blocks nothing else in this prompt, but blocks any future provider-chain reordering decision.
2. **Whether to also restore blocking `eval-gate.yml` CI and wire Semgrep now** — both are fully spec'd in note 12 (P0-2, P1) but deliberately excluded from this prompt's scope per the user's own framing of what "tightened" covers this round. Flagging in case the user wants them folded in.
3. **Sanity token scope and CORS list (Task 4b/4c)** and **Cloudflare WAF rule deployment status (Task 5)** are genuinely unknown until someone opens those dashboards — this prompt cannot resolve them, only tell the operator exactly what to look for and what to paste in if missing.

## Evidence

Verified read-only against `/home/anant_gupta/projects/hub/portfolio` (branch `post-frontend`) and a live `curl -I` against production, 2026-09-05, in this session (not carried forward unverified from notes 11/12):

- `src/lib/model-router.ts` — full file, provider chain, cooldown, Groq metadata check
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` — lines ~200-230 (Upstash fail-open catch), ~460-560 (stream finish handler, Groq in-stream check, sanitizer call)
- `src/lib/chat-sanitizer.ts` — full regex set for leaked tool-call JSON (lines 12-148)
- `src/app/api/orby-comment/route.ts` — full file, confirmed no HMAC gate
- `src/sanity/lib/live.ts` — lines 1-30, confirmed shared server/browser token
- `src/proxy.ts` — full file, matcher config
- `next.config.ts` — CSP header block
- `.github/workflows/eval-gate.yml` — full file, `continue-on-error: true` confirmed
- `.claude/commands/ship-check.md`, `.claude/commands/deploy.md` — confirmed existing review pipeline
- `security/cloudflare-strategy.md`, `security/manual-actions.md` (Phases 2, 3, 5, 6) — existing dashboard-step specs, reused not re-derived
- Live `curl -I https://anantgupta.dev` — confirmed enforced CSP, `server: cloudflare` + `cf-ray` alongside `x-vercel-id`, HSTS, and Cloudflare Turnstile domains present in the CSP's `script-src`/`connect-src`/`frame-src`
- `grep -r semgrep` and `find -iname "*.semgrep*"` across repo — both empty, confirming note 11/12's claim

This note picks exactly six things out of them (plus one dashboard gate they share) that the user named as the current \"security layer thin → tightened\" bridge, re-verifies each personally against live code/live DNS one more time, resolves the one open ambiguity (Cloudflare), and turns the result into a single implementation prompt Cursor can execute in one sitting. Read notes 11/12 for background; read this note to actually do the work.\n\n## Re-verification pass (2026-09-05, this session)\n\nEverything below was independently re-checked against the live repo/live domain in this session, not carried forward from notes 11/12 unread:\n\n- **Provider chain, budget tiering, cooldown mechanics** — confirmed against `src/lib/model-router.ts` directly (full file read). Matches note 11 exactly: `Cerebras zai-glm-4.7 → Groq llama-3.3-70b-versatile → Mistral mistral-small-latest → degraded`.\n- **CSP enforced, `/api/health` public, Clerk scoped to `/studio(.*)` only** — confirmed against `next.config.ts`, `src/proxy.ts`, and a live `curl -I https://anantgupta.dev` (see below). Matches note 11.\n- **`/api/orby-comment` has no HMAC/Turnstile gate** — confirmed by reading the full route file: it has `BLOCKED_UA`, `isAllowedOrigin`, and a 3/60s per-IP Upstash limiter, but no `chat-token` verification. Matches note 11/12.\n- **`SANITY_API_TOKEN` is used as both `serverToken` and `browserToken`** — confirmed in `src/sanity/lib/live.ts:8-14`. Matches note 11/12.\n- **`eval-gate.yml` is advisory (`continue-on-error: true`)**, uses `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` — confirmed. No Semgrep config anywhere in the repo (grep empty). Matches note 11/12. **Both restoring the blocking eval gate and wiring Semgrep are already fully specified in note 12 (P0-2, P1) and are deliberately NOT duplicated in this prompt — out of scope here, see \"Explicitly out of scope\" below.**\n- **Cloudflare is genuinely the live edge, not just header-shaped code** — resolved by live `curl -I https://anantgupta.dev`:\n  ```\n  server: cloudflare\n  cf-ray: a3632b3c8b1f4ca0-MSP\n  cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC\n  x-vercel-id: cle1::iad1::rpzpc-...\n  x-vercel-cache: MISS\n  ```\n  Both a real Cloudflare ray ID *and* a real Vercel deployment ID are present on the same response — this is Cloudflare (orange-cloud proxy) sitting in front of Vercel, exactly as [[security/cloudflare-strategy]] designed it, not `request-guards.ts` opportunistically reading headers that don't mean anything. **The ambiguity the user asked to resolve is resolved: Cloudflare is real infrastructure here, and concrete WAF rules for it already exist** (see Task 5).\n- **The Cerebras leak fix is NOT \"reuse Groq's exact mechanism\" as note 12 frames it** — corrected below in Task 2. Groq's provider-level check in `model-router.ts` inspects `JSON.stringify(response)` *before* streaming starts, which only works because Groq's SDK surfaces `tool_use_failed` as response metadata. Cerebras's failure (the model narrates a tool call as plain text instead of invoking it) does not exist yet at that point — it only appears once the stream's text content arrives, which is too late to swap providers for *this* turn. The real, already-half-built mechanism to extend is in `chat/route.ts`'s stream `finish` handler and `sanitizeChatText()` (see Task 2) — smaller diff, and provably matches what the code actually does today.\n\n---\n\n## What this prompt covers (and what it deliberately doesn't)\n\n**In scope:** Clerk re-verification, the Cerebras tool-leak cooldown fix, HMAC-gating `/api/orby-comment`, the Sanity token/CORS/mutation-path check, the Cloudflare WAF verification (resolved, not designed from scratch), the Upstash fail-open logging upgrade, and the AI-use-policy content spec (handed off to the SEO/AEO prompt's privacy-page task, not built here).\n\n**Explicitly out of scope (tracked elsewhere, do not duplicate):**\n- Restoring blocking `eval-gate.yml` CI and wiring Semgrep — fully specified in [[nextgen-chatbot/12 - Orby Hardening Implementation Guide - 2026-09-05]] P0-2 and P1. Separate task.\n- Reordering or adding a 4th provider leg — gated on the Cerebras billing dashboard check (P0-0 below), and out of scope for this specific ask regardless.\n- Building the actual `/privacy` page — that's `[[AEO & SEO/02 - SEO to AEO Implementation Prompt - 2026-09-05]]` Task 4. This note only supplies the AI-specific content that page must include.\n- Orby visual/animation polish — separate frontend session (`frontend/UI Fixes.md`).\n\n---\n\n## Implementation prompt\n\n> Written for a single autonomous coding session (Claude Sonnet 5 in Cursor). Context is front-loaded; no follow-up turn should be needed to clarify scope. Some tasks are dashboard-only verification, not code — they are written as explicit numbered steps to report back on, not as code TODOs.\n\n```\nREPO: hub/portfolio — Next.js 16 App Router, Clerk auth, Sanity CMS, an AI chat\nagent (Orby / Portfolio Lab) behind Cerebras → Groq → Mistral → degraded mode,\nUpstash Redis for rate limiting, Cloudflare (proxied DNS) in front of Vercel.\n\nREAD-ONLY constraint: do not run pnpm commands, do not call any AI provider,\ndo not print or log any env var VALUE (names are fine). Only touch the files\nnamed in each task below. Do not touch frontend/UI components.\n\nDo these seven tasks in order. Each is independently scoped — do not let a\nfinding in one task change your approach to another unless a task explicitly\nsays so.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTASK 0 — Cerebras billing status (manual check, non-blocking for Tasks 1-6)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nCerebras's no-card free tier reportedly ended in August 2026; new accounts\nnow get a one-time $5 credit expiring 30 days after a payment method is\nadded. This project's Cerebras key may predate that change and be\ngrandfathered, or may not be.\n\nAsk the human operator to check https://cloud.cerebras.ai (Billing/Usage tab)\nfor the account tied to the live CEREBRAS_API_KEY, and report back: (a) is a\npayment method on file, (b) credit balance and expiry if on the trial, (c)\nwhich pricing tier the account is actually on. Do not guess or assume an\nanswer. This does not block Tasks 1-6 below (none of them depend on Cerebras\nstaying primary) — it only matters for a future decision about reordering\nPROVIDER_CHAIN, which is explicitly not part of this task.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTASK 1 — Re-verify Clerk/Studio auth boundary (verify only, no code change\nexpected)\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRead src/proxy.ts in full. Confirm:\n- The only protected route matcher is `/studio(.*)` via `createRouteMatcher`.\n- `/api/health`, `/api/error-report`, and `/api/chat` are excluded from both\n  matcher patterns in `export const config`.\n- `src/app/studio/layout.tsx` and `src/app/studio/page.tsx` do not have a\n  second, conflicting auth check that could either double-protect or\n  accidentally bypass the proxy-level guard.\n\nReport exactly what you find. If it matches the above (it did on\n2026-09-05), make NO code change — this task exists to catch drift, not to\nforce a change. If it does NOT match, stop and report the discrepancy before\ntouching anything; this is an auth boundary, not a place to guess a fix.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTASK 2 — Cerebras tool-call leak: set a real cooldown, don't just clean text\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFile: src/app/api/chat/route.ts (the stream `finish` handler, look for the\nexisting `// Groq tool_use_failed detection (in-stream)` comment and the\n`sanitizeChatText(accText)` call a few lines below it).\n\nCONTEXT — verified, not guessed: sanitizeChatText() (src/lib/chat-sanitizer.ts)\nalready generically strips leaked tool-call JSON from ANY provider's output\nvia several regexes (`{\"tool\":...}`, `{\"function\":...}`, `{\"name\":\n\"navigate\"|...}`, etc.) and returns `cleanText` plus `extractedSectionId` when\nit successfully reconstructs a navigation intent from leaked text. This\nalready partially handles the Cerebras leak for the CURRENT turn. What is\nmissing: when sanitizeChatText actually found and stripped something\n(`sanitized.cleanText !== accText`), nothing tells the router this provider\njust had a soft failure — so on the visitor's VERY NEXT message, Cerebras is\ntried again with the same odds of leaking again. There is no cooldown set.\n\nDo NOT attempt to detect the leak before streaming starts and swap providers\nmid-turn — Cerebras's failure only exists in the streamed text, not in the\npre-stream response object (that's why Groq's `JSON.stringify(response)`\nmetadata check in model-router.ts doesn't transfer here; it relies on Groq's\nSDK surfacing an error field that Cerebras's generic OpenAI-compatible client\ndoes not have for this failure mode). Reusing that specific mechanism here\nwould be a no-op, not a fix — do not do it.\n\nTHE FIX: immediately after the existing `const sanitized =\nsanitizeChatText(accText);` line, if `sanitized.cleanText !== accText` (i.e.\nthe sanitizer actually found and stripped leaked tool-call JSON) AND\n`routeResult.provider !== \"groq\"` (Groq already has its own harder failure\npath a few lines above — don't double-handle it), set the same cooldown key\nthe router already uses: `chat:cooldown:${routeResult.provider}` in Upstash,\nTTL 30s, via the same Redis client pattern already used in\nsrc/lib/model-router.ts (`redis.set(cooldownKey, \"1\", { ex: 30 })`) — you'll\nneed to either import/instantiate Redis the same way route.ts already does\nelsewhere in this file, or export a small helper from model-router.ts and\nimport it (whichever is the smaller diff given what's already imported in\nroute.ts — check before deciding). Emit a structured log line matching this\nfile's existing convention: `console.log(JSON.stringify({ event:\n\"chat.tool_leak.cooldown_set\", provider: routeResult.provider, sessionId\n}))`.\n\nDo not change the existing Groq hard-fail block above it. Do not change\nsanitizeChatText's regexes. Do not change what gets sent to the client for\nthis turn — the sanitizer's existing cleanup/synthetic-navigate behavior for\nthe CURRENT turn is unchanged; this task only makes the NEXT turn route\naround a provider that just leaked.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTASK 3 — HMAC-gate /api/orby-comment\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFile: src/app/api/orby-comment/route.ts\n\nThis route currently checks BLOCKED_UA, isAllowedOrigin, and a 3-req/60s\nUpstash limiter, but never verifies the HMAC session cookie that\n/api/chat requires. It still calls routeChat() (the same Cerebras → Groq →\nMistral chain), so an unauthenticated caller can consume real provider quota\ntoday.\n\nFind the exact HMAC verification helper /api/chat/route.ts uses (it reads a\nsigned httpOnly cookie issued by /api/chat-token — check\nsrc/lib/chat-token.ts for the verify function's exact name and signature).\nImport and call that same helper in orby-comment/route.ts's POST handler,\npositioned after the UA/origin checks and before the rate limiter (cheapest\nchecks first, matching the existing order in this file). On missing/invalid\ntoken, return the same 401 shape /api/chat already returns for this case —\ndo not invent a different response shape for what is the same failure mode.\n\nDo not build a second token-issuance mechanism. Do not change\n/api/chat-token/route.ts. Do not change the existing UA/origin/rate-limit\nchecks already in orby-comment/route.ts — this task only adds one more gate\nto the existing chain.\n\nVERIFY:\ncurl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\" -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/orby-comment \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Origin: http://localhost:3000\"\nBefore this fix: 200. After this fix: 401 (matching the documented\n/api/chat behavior in security/manual-actions.md's Phase 3 curl check).\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTASK 4 — Sanity safety net: one code check, two dashboard checks\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4a (code, verify-only): grep the entire src/ tree (excluding anything under\nsrc/app/studio/**, which is expected to have Studio's own write path) for\nSanity mutation calls: `.create(`, `.createOrReplace(`, `.createIfNotExists(`,\n`.patch(`, `.delete(`, `.mutate(`, `client.transaction(`. Report every match\nwith file:line. Note 11 claims zero mutation calls exist in the Next.js\nlayer outside Studio — confirm or refute this with the actual grep output,\ndon't just restate the claim.\n\n4b (dashboard, manual — report back, do not guess): ask the human operator to\nopen https://www.sanity.io/manage → project → API → Tokens, find the token\nset as SANITY_API_TOKEN, and confirm its Permissions column reads exactly\n\"Viewer\". This token is passed as BOTH serverToken and browserToken in\nsrc/sanity/lib/live.ts, meaning it is shipped to the browser via the Live\nContent API's SSE connection — if it is anything more permissive than\nViewer, that is a real write-capable token exposed client-side. If it is not\nViewer, do not attempt to fix this from code; report it and stop, this is a\ndashboard-only remediation (rotate the token in Sanity, per\nsecurity/manual-actions.md 2A).\n\n4c (dashboard, manual — report back): ask the human operator to open the\nsame project's API → CORS Origins list and confirm it contains only known\norigins (localhost:3000, the production domain, any preview domains\nactually in use) with no wildcard `*` entry.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTASK 5 — Cloudflare WAF: verify deployment, don't redesign rules\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nCloudflare is confirmed live in front of this domain (verified via\n`curl -I https://<production domain>` showing both a `cf-ray` header and a\nVercel `x-vercel-id` header on the same response — Cloudflare is proxying to\nVercel, not a phantom). Concrete WAF rules for this exact setup already exist\nin the vault (security/cloudflare-strategy.md Part 2, security/manual-actions.md\n6D) — this task is a DEPLOYMENT verification, not a rule-design task.\n\nAsk the human operator to open the Cloudflare dashboard for this domain →\nSecurity → WAF and confirm, reporting back exactly what's found for each:\n1. Custom Rule blocking scanner user-agents (sqlmap, nikto, nmap, masscan,\n   zgrab, nuclei) — deployed and active?\n2. Custom Rule blocking empty User-Agent on `/api/*` paths — deployed and\n   active?\n3. Rate Limiting Rule on the chat API path (~20 req/60s per IP, block\n   action) — deployed and active?\n4. SSL/TLS mode set to \"Full (strict)\", not \"Full\" or \"Flexible\"?\n\nIf any of these four are missing, the exact rule text to paste in is already\nwritten in security/cloudflare-strategy.md \"Part 2 — WAF rules\" and\nsecurity/manual-actions.md section 6D — do not write new rule expressions,\ncopy those verbatim. Do not attempt to configure Cloudflare via API/Terraform\nin this session — this is a dashboard-only task, report status and let the\nhuman operator apply anything missing.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTASK 6 — Upstash fail-open: keep the behavior, upgrade the observability\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFile: src/app/api/chat/route.ts, the catch block around the rate-limit calls\ncontaining: `console.warn(\"[chat] Upstash unreachable — rate limiting\nskipped\", err);`\n\nDECISION (already made, do not re-litigate): keep fail-open. On a Redis\noutage, letting the chat endpoint keep serving (rather than 500ing every\nvisitor) is the right tradeoff for a portfolio site — the provider chain's\nown per-provider rate limits are a second layer that still caps runaway\ncost even with Upstash down, and a Redis blip is rarer than \"recruiter mid-\nconversation gets a hard error.\" Do not change this to fail-closed.\n\nTHE ACTUAL GAP: this is a plain console.warn with no structured `event`\nfield, unlike every other log line in this file and in model-router.ts\n(which all use `console.log(JSON.stringify({ event: \"...\", ... }))`). That\nmakes a live Upstash outage invisible to any log-based alerting that filters\non the `event` field. Change this one line to match the file's existing\nstructured-logging convention: `console.log(JSON.stringify({ event:\n\"chat.ratelimit.fail_open\", ip }))` — keep it as a genuine log (not an\nerror/throw), keep the exact same fail-open control flow, just make the\nevent structured and include the client IP (already computed earlier in\nthis function via getClientIp). Do the identical thing to the equivalent\nline in src/app/api/orby-comment/route.ts if one exists there too — check,\ndon't assume.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nTASK 7 — AI-use policy: content spec only, no page to build here\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDo NOT create a /privacy route or any new page in this task — that page is\nbuilt by a separate SEO/AEO implementation prompt. Your job here is to\nproduce a short, factual list of what that page's AI-specific section must\ndisclose, based on what Orby's code actually does (verify each line against\nthe router/tools/context files named, don't invent boilerplate):\n\n- Orby only answers using a fixed catalog fetched from Sanity CMS per\n  request (src/lib/chat-context.ts) — it does not browse the web or access\n  data outside that catalog.\n- Orby's available actions are a fixed, closed set of tools (name them —\n  check src/lib/chat-tools.ts for the real current list) — it cannot take\n  arbitrary actions on the visitor's behalf.\n- Messages are routed to third-party model providers in this order: Cerebras,\n  then Groq, then Mistral, falling back to pre-written responses if all are\n  unavailable (verify this is still the live order in model-router.ts before\n  writing it down). State plainly, without hedging or omission, whether any\n  of these providers' free tiers may log or use submitted prompts (check\n  each provider's current published terms — do not assume a policy that was\n  true when [[nextgen-chatbot/05 - Model Layer, Rate Limiting & Abuse]] was\n  written in June 2026 is still current; verify freshly).\n- Whether conversation history persists beyond the active browser session\n  (verify: does anything write chat messages to a database, or does state\n  live only in the client + a short-TTL Redis session counter?).\n- That a bot-check (Cloudflare Turnstile) runs before a chat session token\n  is issued, and why (abuse prevention, not tracking).\n\nOutput this as a plain markdown list appended to THIS note (not a new file,\nnot a new route) under a new \"## AI-Use Policy Content (for /privacy)\"\nheading, so the SEO/AEO prompt's privacy-page task can paste it in directly.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFINAL REPORT\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFor each of Tasks 0-7, state: what you found, what you changed (file:line)\nor explicitly did not change, and for every dashboard-only item, the exact\nquestion the human operator still needs to answer. Run `pnpm typecheck` on\nany file you touched (Tasks 2, 3, 6 only) and paste the output — do not run\n`pnpm build`, `pnpm dev`, or anything that would call a live provider. Do not\ncommit or push anything.\n```\n\n---\n\n## AI-Use Policy Content (for `/privacy`)\n\n*(Placeholder — Task 7 above is written to be executed by the coding agent\nthat runs this prompt, which will verify the current tool list/provider\nterms/session-persistence facts against live code and fill this section in\nbefore handing off to [[AEO & SEO/02 - SEO to AEO Implementation Prompt - 2026-09-05]]'s privacy-page task. Do not treat this section as populated until that run completes — the SEO/AEO prompt's Task 4 should re-check whether this heading has real content before writing the page, and ask the user if it's still empty.)*\n\n---\n\n## Decisions kicked back to the user\n\n1. **Cerebras billing status (Task 0)** — cannot be checked from the repo; needs a dashboard login. Blocks nothing else in this prompt, but blocks any future provider-chain reordering decision.\n2. **Whether to also restore blocking `eval-gate.yml` CI and wire Semgrep now** — both are fully spec'd in note 12 (P0-2, P1) but deliberately excluded from this prompt's scope per the user's own framing of what \"tightened\" covers this round. Flagging in case the user wants them folded in.\n3. **Sanity token scope and CORS list (Task 4b/4c)** and **Cloudflare WAF rule deployment status (Task 5)** are genuinely unknown until someone opens those dashboards — this prompt cannot resolve them, only tell the operator exactly what to look for and what to paste in if missing.\n\n## Evidence\n\nVerified read-only against `/home/anant_gupta/projects/hub/portfolio` (branch `post-frontend`) and a live `curl -I` against production, 2026-09-05, in this session (not carried forward unverified from notes 11/12):\n\n- `src/lib/model-router.ts` — full file, provider chain, cooldown, Groq metadata check\n- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` — lines ~200-230 (Upstash fail-open catch), ~460-560 (stream finish handler, Groq in-stream check, sanitizer call)\n- `src/lib/chat-sanitizer.ts` — full regex set for leaked tool-call JSON (lines 12-148)\n- `src/app/api/orby-comment/route.ts` — full file, confirmed no HMAC gate\n- `src/sanity/lib/live.ts` — lines 1-30, confirmed shared server/browser token\n- `src/proxy.ts` — full file, matcher config\n- `next.config.ts` — CSP header block\n- `.github/workflows/eval-gate.yml` — full file, `continue-on-error: true` confirmed\n- `.claude/commands/ship-check.md`, `.claude/commands/deploy.md` — confirmed existing review pipeline\n- `security/cloudflare-strategy.md`, `security/manual-actions.md` (Phases 2, 3, 5, 6) — existing dashboard-step specs, reused not re-derived\n- Live `curl -I https://anantgupta.dev` — confirmed enforced CSP, `server: cloudflare` + `cf-ray` alongside `x-vercel-id`, HSTS, and Cloudflare Turnstile domains present in the CSP's `script-src`/`connect-src`/`frame-src`\n- `grep -r semgrep` and `find -iname \"*.semgrep*\"` across repo — both empty, confirming note 11/12's claim\n\n## Related Notes\n\n- Extends and narrows: [[nextgen-chatbot/11 - Orby Security & Reliability Ground Truth - 2026-09-05]], [[nextgen-chatbot/12 - Orby Hardening Implementation Guide - 2026-09-05]]\n- Reuses dashboard steps from: [[security/manual-actions]], [[security/cloudflare-strategy]]\n- Hands off content to: [[AEO & SEO/02 - SEO to AEO Implementation Prompt - 2026-09-05]] (privacy page)\n- Does not touch: frontend UI (`frontend/UI Fixes.md`), the eval-gate/Semgrep CI work (note 12 P0-2/P1)\n"}`

Note 01 is phased 5A–5E across five concerns in parallel; this note collapses that into a strict two-phase build a coding agent can actually execute in one sitting: ship the SEO basics first, only then layer AEO on top. Read note 01 for the \"why\" and the full research citations; read this note to actually build it.\n\n## Re-verification pass (2026-09-05, this session)\n\nRe-checked directly against the live repo, not carried forward from note 01 unread:\n\n- `src/app/layout.tsx` (root) — **confirmed zero metadata export of any kind.** No `metadata`, no `metadataBase`, no title. Full file read.\n- `src/app/(portfolio)/layout.tsx` — **confirmed** `generateMetadata()` exists (async, fetches `SITE_SETTINGS_QUERY`), returns `title`, `description`, `openGraph` (title/description/type/images), `twitter` (card/title/description/images). **Confirmed missing:** `metadataBase`, `alternates.canonical`, `openGraph.url`, `openGraph.siteName`, `openGraph.locale`. Full file read — this is the exact function to extend, not replace.\n- `src/app/sitemap.ts`, `src/app/robots.ts`, any `/privacy` route, any `application/ld+json` or `schema.org` string anywhere in `src/` — **all confirmed absent** by direct `find`/`grep` in this session. Matches note 01's status table exactly; nothing shipped since 2026-09-05's earlier note-01 pass (this check ran minutes later, same day).\n- **Real Sanity field names for the structured-data spec** (checked `src/sanity/lib/queries.ts` directly — note 01's JSON-LD drafts used placeholder field names, this corrects them to what actually exists):\n  - `PROFILE_QUERY` returns: `firstName`, `lastName`, `headline`, `shortBio`, `fullBio`, `email`, `location`, `socialLinks{ github, linkedin, twitter, website, medium, devto, youtube, stackoverflow }`.\n  - `SITE_SETTINGS_QUERY` returns: `siteTitle`, `siteDescription`, `siteLogo`.\n  - Note 01's `Person.sameAs` draft used hardcoded placeholder URLs (`REPLACE_IF_PUBLIC`) — the real fix is to build `sameAs` dynamically from `socialLinks`, filtering out empty fields, not to fill in placeholder strings by hand.\n- **Canonical domain confirmed live and Cloudflare-fronted:** `https://anantgupta.dev` (matches note 01, confirmed again via `curl -I` in the companion security prompt's verification pass).\n\n---\n\n## Why this is a strict sequence, not five parallel phases\n\nNote 01's own status table shows Phases 1 and 3 partially done, Phase 2 and 4 not started, Phase 5 blocked on 1–4. Working all of that as one undifferentiated backlog is exactly the \"wide, not narrow\" problem this session exists to fix. Concretely:\n\n- A crawler cannot resolve relative OG image URLs or canonical links without `metadataBase` existing first — so **Task 1 must land before Task 2 makes new claims meaningful.**\n- `sitemap.ts` should reference `/privacy` — so **the privacy page (Task 3) ships before the sitemap (Task 4).**\n- The AI-crawler-specific robots rules (`OAI-SearchBot`, `ClaudeBot`, etc.) are additions to the *same* `robots.ts` file the SEO-basics phase creates — writing them before the base file exists means guessing at a file structure that doesn't exist yet. **AEO's robots work (Phase 2) extends Phase 1's `robots.ts`, it doesn't duplicate it.**\n- The AEO audit (asking ChatGPT/Perplexity \"what do you know about this site\") is explicitly, in note 00's own words, worthless before there's anything for a crawler to find — so it stays a Phase 2 measurement step, not a Phase 1 one.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation prompt\n\n> Written for a single autonomous coding session (Claude Sonnet 5 in Cursor). Context is front-loaded. **Do not start Phase 2 until every Phase 1 task is done and verified** — this is a hard gate, not a suggestion.\n\n```\nREPO: hub/portfolio — Next.js 16 App Router, content sourced from Sanity CMS\nvia `sanityFetch()` (see src/sanity/lib/queries.ts, src/sanity/lib/live.ts).\nProduction domain: https://anantgupta.dev (Cloudflare-proxied to Vercel).\n\nCONSTRAINT: do not invent facts. Every string you put in metadata, JSON-LD,\nor page copy must come from a real Sanity field (query it) or be plainly\ngeneric/factual (e.g. \"Next.js 16 App Router site\"), never a placeholder\nvalue presented as real (no fake email, no fake social URL, no invented\ntestimonial/rating). If a field is empty in Sanity (e.g. no Twitter handle),\nomit that field entirely rather than filling in a placeholder string.\n\nDo not touch application logic unrelated to metadata/SEO (no component\nredesigns, no changes to chat/Orby code — that's a separate prompt).\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nPHASE 1 — SEO BASICS (do all of these, in this order, before Phase 2)\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nTASK 1 — Root metadata defaults\nFile: src/app/layout.tsx (currently has zero metadata export — confirmed).\nAdd a static `export const metadata: Metadata = { ... }` (this layout is not\nasync and doesn't need Sanity data, so a static export is correct — don't\nconvert it to generateMetadata just to match the nested layout's pattern).\nInclude: `metadataBase: new URL(\"https://anantgupta.dev\")`, `title: {\ndefault: \"Anant Gupta | AI & Full-Stack Portfolio\", template: \"%s | Anant\nGupta\" }`, a plain factual `description` (one sentence, not ad copy — e.g.\n\"Portfolio and AI lab for Anant Gupta, a computer science student building\nNext.js applications with a grounded AI chat agent.\"). Do not add openGraph/\ntwitter here — the nested portfolio layout already owns those with real CMS\ndata; adding a second, static copy here would create two competing sources\nthat Next.js's metadata merge would then need to reconcile.\n\nTASK 2 — Extend the existing portfolio layout metadata\nFile: src/app/(portfolio)/layout.tsx — extend the existing\n`generateMetadata()` function, do not rewrite it or change its CMS-driven\ntitle/description logic.\nAdd to the returned object: `alternates: { canonical: \"/\" }`,\n`openGraph.url: \"https://anantgupta.dev\"`, `openGraph.siteName:\n\"Anant Gupta Portfolio\"`, `openGraph.locale: \"en_US\"`. Leave the existing\n`ogImage` (from `settings.siteLogo`) logic untouched — just fold the new\nfields into the same returned `openGraph` object. If `settings.siteLogo`\nresolves to an image that isn't roughly 1200×630, note this in your final\nreport as a follow-up (don't attempt to generate a new asset in this task).\n\nTASK 3 — Privacy policy page\nNew file: src/app/privacy/page.tsx (a plain Server Component page, `noindex`\nnot required — this page SHOULD be indexed and linked from the sitemap).\nContent must cover, factually and specifically to this app (no generic SaaS\nprivacy-policy boilerplate): Clerk (auth, Studio only), Cloudflare Turnstile\n(bot check before chat), Upstash Redis (rate limiting, session counters),\nSanity (content storage, no user data), Vercel Analytics (traffic), and the\nAI provider chain.\n\nFor the AI-provider section specifically: read the \"## AI-Use Policy\nContent (for /privacy)\" heading in\n[[security/06 - Security Hardening Implementation Prompt - 2026-09-05]]\nfirst. If that heading has real, filled-in content (not the placeholder\nnote saying it's pending), use it verbatim as the source for this section.\nIf it is still a placeholder when you run this task, stop before writing\nthe AI-provider section, tell the user that note hasn't been executed yet,\nand ask whether to (a) wait for it, or (b) write this section yourself by\ndirectly checking src/lib/model-router.ts, src/lib/chat-tools.ts, and\nsrc/lib/chat-context.ts for the same facts that task would have verified\n(provider order, closed tool list, catalog-only grounding, session-only\npersistence). Do not silently invent this section either way.\n\nTASK 4 — sitemap.ts\nNew file: src/app/sitemap.ts using Next.js's `MetadataRoute.Sitemap` export.\nEntries: `https://anantgupta.dev/` and `https://anantgupta.dev/privacy`\n(only add more entries if other real indexable routes exist — check\nsrc/app/ first, don't invent routes). Use an accurate `lastModified` (the\nactual current date at build time, e.g. `new Date()`, not a hardcoded\nstring).\n\nTASK 5 — robots.ts (baseline only — AI-crawler-specific rules come in\nPhase 2, do not add them yet)\nNew file: src/app/robots.ts using Next.js's `MetadataRoute.Robots` export.\nBaseline rules only: `Allow: /`, `Disallow: /api/`, `Disallow: /studio/`,\nand a `sitemap` field pointing at `https://anantgupta.dev/sitemap.xml`.\nDo not add per-bot rules yet — that's Task 7.\n\nTASK 6 — Structured data (Person, ProfilePage, WebSite)\nAdd a `<script type=\"application/ld+json\">` to the home page\n(src/app/(portfolio)/page.tsx — check whether it already fetches\nPROFILE_QUERY and/or SITE_SETTINGS_QUERY for rendering the Hero/About\nsections; if so, reuse that fetched data rather than issuing a second\nsanityFetch call for the same documents).\n\nEmit one `@graph` array containing:\n- `ProfilePage` (`@id`: \"https://anantgupta.dev/#profilepage\", `mainEntity`\n  pointing at the Person node below)\n- `Person` (`@id`: \"https://anantgupta.dev/#person\") — populate `name` from\n  `firstName`+`lastName`, `jobTitle`/`description` from `headline`/\n  `shortBio`, `email` as `mailto:${profile.email}` only if `email` is\n  non-empty, `url` as the canonical domain, `sameAs` as an array built by\n  filtering `socialLinks` (github/linkedin/twitter/website/medium/devto/\n  youtube/stackoverflow) down to only the non-empty ones — do not hardcode\n  any of these URLs, do not include a key in `sameAs` for a platform that's\n  empty in Sanity.\n- `WebSite` (`@id`: \"https://anantgupta.dev/#website\") — `name` from\n  `siteTitle`, `description` from `siteDescription`, `publisher` pointing\n  at the Person `@id`, `inLanguage: \"en-US\"`.\n\nEvery field must match text that's actually visible on the rendered page —\ndo not add a claim to the JSON-LD that isn't also readable in the HTML\n(this is a hard Google structured-data requirement, not a style\npreference).\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nGATE — before starting Phase 2\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nConfirm all of Phase 1 is done: run the app locally (pnpm dev is fine here,\nthis is a metadata/SEO task, not the security prompt's no-run constraint),\nview source on `/`, and confirm: metadataBase resolves (OG image URLs are\nabsolute, not relative), `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` both render,\n`/privacy` loads, and the JSON-LD script tag is present and valid. Only\nproceed past this point once all four are true.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nPHASE 2 — AEO EVOLUTION (only after Phase 1 is verified done)\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nTASK 7 — Extend robots.ts with AI-crawler-specific rules\nFile: src/app/robots.ts (the one Task 5 created — extend it, don't create a\nsecond file). Add per-bot rules on top of the existing baseline:\n- `OAI-SearchBot`: Allow / (this is what makes the site eligible for ChatGPT\n  search citations — do not block this one even if blocking GPTBot).\n- `GPTBot`: optional Disallow / (training opt-out; ask the user which they\n  want before deciding — don't default to blocking without asking, since\n  it's a real tradeoff, not a pure win).\n- `PerplexityBot`: Allow /.\n- `Claude-SearchBot`: Allow /.\n- `ClaudeBot`: optional Disallow / (same training-opt-out tradeoff as\n  GPTBot — ask, don't default).\n- `Claude-User`: Allow / (user-triggered fetches; blocking this reduces\n  visibility for zero training-opt-out benefit, so allow it regardless of\n  the ClaudeBot decision above).\n- `Google-Extended`: optional Disallow / (same tradeoff family as above).\nKeep the existing baseline `Disallow: /api/`, `Disallow: /studio/` for the\ndefault/wildcard user-agent unchanged.\n\nTASK 8 — SoftwareApplication structured data for Portfolio Lab / Orby\nAdd a second `@graph` node (same JSON-LD script from Task 6, or a second\nscript block — check which produces cleaner output) with `@type:\n[\"SoftwareApplication\", \"WebApplication\"]`, `name: \"Orby — Portfolio Lab\"`,\n`applicationCategory: \"BusinessApplication\"`, `operatingSystem: \"Web\"`,\n`author` pointing at the Person `@id` from Task 6, `offers: { \"@type\":\n\"Offer\", price: \"0\", priceCurrency: \"USD\" }`. For `description` and\n`featureList`, verify the actual current persona list and tool list against\nsrc/lib/personas.ts and src/lib/chat-tools.ts before writing them — don't\ncopy note 01's draft list without checking it's still accurate.\n\nTASK 9 — llms.txt\nNew file: public/llms.txt (static, not a route — Next.js serves files from\npublic/ at the root path automatically). Content: a short markdown map\nper the draft in [[AEO & SEO/01 - SEO & AEO Discoverability Strategy]]'s\n\"llms.txt Starter\" section — adapt the links to whatever real routes exist\nafter Phase 1 (home, /privacy, GitHub). This is explicitly a courtesy file,\nnot a ranking lever (Google has stated it doesn't use llms.txt) — don't\nover-invest time here beyond adapting the existing draft.\n\nTASK 10 — Measurement follow-ups (manual, not code — report back, don't\nguess or fabricate data)\nAsk the human operator to: (a) submit/resubmit the sitemap in Google Search\nConsole (property already exists per note 01) and Bing Webmaster Tools\n(status unconfirmed — ask whether it's set up at all), (b) run the AEO audit\nfrom note 00: ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude directly \"what do you know\nabout anantgupta.dev?\" / \"who is Anant Gupta, CS portfolio?\" and record the\nactual answers, (c) export GSC's last-28-days Performance report\n(impressions/clicks/top queries) once there's been time to index. Do not\ninvent or estimate these numbers yourselves — they don't exist yet for an\nunindexed site, and note 00 already flags running this audit before Phase 1\nships as measuring a known-empty state.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nFINAL REPORT\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nList every file created/modified with a one-line description. For every\n\"ask the user\" branch point above (GPTBot/ClaudeBot/Google-Extended\ntraining opt-out, whether Task 3's AI-policy content was ready), state\nwhich way you went and why, or that you stopped and are waiting on an\nanswer. Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` and paste the output.

## You

Now for the seo session, provide me with a prompt for it come up with a paln to build out the base and initial system for seo and aeo base. Notes have been made better we need to now get stated on the build. So, provide me with an excellentprompt for thecursor ongoing session that we provided the prompt to.

## Claude

Here's the handoff prompt — pointed at the note you already have rather than re-deriving it, since `AEO & SEO/02` already contains the literal Phase 1 task spec.

```
Repo: hub/portfolio (Next.js 16 App Router), branch `post-frontend` — this branch
already has a large uncommitted diff from an unrelated frontend UI-fix pass. Do
not touch, stage, or worry about any of that diff; only create/edit the files
named below. Do not commit or push anything — the user commits everything
themselves in this repo.

This session is switching from research/notes-only to actually building. Read
the vault note `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/AEO & SEO/02 - SEO to AEO
Implementation Prompt - 2026-09-05.md` in full — not a skim. It already
contains a literal, file-by-file implementation spec (Phase 1: Tasks 1–6,
"SEO basics"; a hard gate; Phase 2: Tasks 7–10, "AEO evolution"), verified
against this exact repo on 2026-09-05, with real Sanity field names and real
file paths already confirmed. Do not re-derive the spec or re-research SEO/AEO
strategy — that work is done and cited in that note and in `01 - SEO & AEO
Discoverability Strategy.md`. Your job now is to plan the build of that spec,
then execute it.

SCOPE FOR THIS SESSION: Phase 1 only (Tasks 1–6 — root metadata, the portfolio
layout metadata extension, the /privacy page, sitemap.ts, robots.ts baseline,
and the Person/ProfilePage/WebSite JSON-LD). Stop at the gate described in
note 02 once Phase 1 is done and verified. Do not start Phase 2 (Tasks 7–10 —
AI-crawler robots rules, the Orby SoftwareApplication schema, llms.txt,
measurement) in this session; that's a deliberate follow-up once Phase 1 is
live, not a scope decision to revisit now.

BEFORE PLANNING: re-verify the repo hasn't drifted since 2026-09-05 — quickly
re-check that `src/app/layout.tsx` still has no metadata export, `src/app/
(portfolio)/layout.tsx` still has the generateMetadata() shape note 02
describes, and that `src/app/sitemap.ts`, `src/app/robots.ts`, and any
`/privacy` route still don't exist. If any of that has changed, note 02's
task text may be stale for that one task — adjust only that task, don't
assume the rest also drifted.

TASK 3 DEPENDENCY: Task 3 (the /privacy page's AI-provider disclosure
section) depends on content from `security/06 - Security Hardening
Implementation Prompt - 2026-09-05.md`'s "## AI-Use Policy Content (for
/privacy)" heading. Check that heading first. If it's still the placeholder
text (the security session hasn't run yet), follow note 02's own fallback
instructions for Task 3 exactly — verify the AI-provider facts yourself
directly from `src/lib/model-router.ts`, `src/lib/chat-tools.ts`, and
`src/lib/chat-context.ts` rather than waiting or inventing content.

WORKFLOW: use Plan Mode first. Produce a plan for Tasks 1–6 in dependency
order (note 02 already specifies the order and why — root metadata before
the layout extension, privacy page before sitemap, sitemap before robots).
Once the plan is approved, execute it for real — this session writes actual
application code (unlike the prior research-only sessions), touching only:
`src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/(portfolio)/layout.tsx`, `src/app/privacy/
page.tsx` (new), `src/app/sitemap.ts` (new), `src/app/robots.ts` (new), and
`src/app/(portfolio)/page.tsx` (JSON-LD script tag, reusing existing fetched
Sanity data if that page already fetches PROFILE_QUERY/SITE_SETTINGS_QUERY).

VERIFY before reporting done, exactly as note 02's own "GATE — before
starting Phase 2" section specifies: run `pnpm dev`, view source on `/`,
confirm metadataBase resolves to absolute URLs, `/sitemap.xml` and
`/robots.txt` both render, `/privacy` loads with real (not placeholder)
content, and the JSON-LD script tag is present and every field in it matches
text actually visible on the page. Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` and
paste the output.

WHEN DONE: write a short completion note back into
`AEO & SEO/02 - SEO to AEO Implementation Prompt - 2026-09-05.md` (append,
don't rewrite the existing content) recording: which of Tasks 1–6 shipped,
which Task-3 fallback path you took and why, any deviation from the spec and
the reason, and explicit confirmation the Phase 1 gate checks all passed.
Do not touch Phase 2's section of that note.
```

One thing to flag before you send this: Task 3 depends on the security session's output, and I don't know if that one has actually been run yet. If it hasn't, this build session will fall back to verifying the AI-provider facts itself directly from code — which works, but means running the security prompt first would save it that detour.

## You

You are picking up a portfolio-hardening effort already in progress. This session's job is NOT to write a broad strategy document — two of those already exist and are the problem, not the solution. Your job is to produce exactly two narrow, singular-topic, execution-ready IMPLEMENTATION PROMPTS — the kind Cursor can paste in and build from in one sitting — not more strategy.

## Project

`hub/portfolio` — Next.js 16 App Router, Tailwind v4, Sanity CMS, Clerk auth, GSAP/R3F, an AI chat agent named Orby (Portfolio Lab). Repo at the working directory. Persistent notes live in an Obsidian vault reachable via the `mcp__jarvis__*` tools, rooted at `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/`.

## What already exists — read ALL of this before touching anything

Three Cursor background-agent plan files (on disk, not in the vault) describe what Cursor already built and why — read them for Cursor's own stated scope and reasoning:
- `/home/anant_gupta/.cursor/plans/[REDACTED].plan.md`
- `/home/anant_gupta/.cursor/plans/seo_aeo_note_92a02281.plan.md`
- `/home/anant_gupta/.cursor/plans/[REDACTED].plan.md`

A prior Claude Code session then verified and deepened the notes those plans produced. Read these, in this order:

1. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/nextgen-chatbot/11 - Orby Security & Reliability Ground Truth - 2026-09-05.md` — line-cited repo verification of the security/reliability posture (Clerk, CSP, rate limits, provider chain, promptfoo eval gate).
2. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/nextgen-chatbot/12 - Orby Hardening Implementation Guide - 2026-09-05.md` — the P0/P1/P2 "how," a per-provider runbook, an OWASP LLM Top 10 cross-reference, and a capacity-reality-check on rate limits. **Read the "P0-0" section closely — Cerebras's free tier changed in August 2026 and the provider chain's whole premise may need re-checking; do not assume it's already resolved.**
3. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/security/README.md` and the five `phase-1-auth-clerk.md` through `phase-5-monitoring.md` files in that same folder.
4. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/AEO & SEO/00 - Agent-Ready Infrastructure Build Plan.md` and `01 - SEO & AEO Discoverability Strategy.md` (the latter now includes a "Ranking #1 for 'Anant Gupta'" section and a portfolio-award-directory table added by a research pass — read those too).
5. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/frontend/frontend-ui-fixes-requirements.md` — for context on what "the build progresses from UI fixes to Orby" actually means sequence-wise; you don't need to touch anything in `frontend/`, it was handled separately.

Do not treat any of the above as wrong by default — they were built through actual live-repo verification, not guesses. But do not treat them as gospel either: verify anything you cite against the live repo yourself before putting it in a prompt Cursor will act on. The prior session found real hallucinated symbols and false claims in an earlier draft of the UI notes (functions that didn't exist, bugs that didn't reproduce in code, an "open question" that got silently resolved wrong) — grep and read the actual files before writing anything that names a file, function, or line number.

## The actual problem

Notes 11, 12, and 01 are comprehensive but wide — each covers many phases and angles at once. That's valuable as a reference, but it's not something Cursor can execute cleanly in one pass, and it's not narrow enough to guarantee the "massive results, singular topic" outcome the user wants. You are building two things that don't exist yet: a focused SEO→AEO execution prompt, and a focused security-hardening execution prompt — each as tight and unambiguous as `frontend/[REDACTED].md`'s "Implementation prompt" section (read that file for the bar to hit: front-loaded context, literal numbered tasks, explicit do-nots, a concrete self-verification checklist, zero ambiguity about what "done" looks like).

## Methodology — no shortcuts, this order, per topic

For EACH of the two topics below, in this exact order:
1. **Read** every vault note and repo file relevant to that topic (lists below are a floor, not a ceiling — follow the trail).
2. **Verify** every concrete claim you intend to reuse against the live repo — grep for the symbol, read the actual line, confirm the file exists at that path. Do not carry forward a citation you haven't personally re-checked.
3. **Research externally** (WebSearch/WebFetch) only for what notes 11/12/01 have NOT already answered well — they already did real research with citations; don't waste time re-deriving what's already sourced, but do chase anything stale, missing, or specific to the two narrow angles below that the broad notes didn't drill into.
4. **Only then write** the one focused implementation prompt for that topic, as a new vault note.

Do topic B (Security) fully — research through written prompt — before starting topic A (SEO/AEO). Reasoning: the SEO note already documents that Agent-Callable Orby via MCP is gated on a security session's sign-off, and the "professional proofing" trust bar the security work sets (grounding, refusal, no hallucination) is a precondition for confidently telling the world to look at this site via SEO/AEO — do the foundation first. If your own research surfaces a reason to reverse this order, say so explicitly and justify it, don't silently reorder.

Do not edit any application source file in either phase. Read-only against the repo, write-only to the vault. Neither deliverable should run `pnpm` commands, call any AI provider, or expose env values.

---

## Topic B — Security Hardening Bridge (do this one first)

Scope, in the user's own framing: as the build moves from UI fixes to Orby being fully wired, the security layer needs to go from "thin" to "tightened," specifically across:

- **Clerk authentication** — is Studio access the only thing gated, and is that actually enough? Re-verify `src/proxy.ts` and `src/app/studio/**` against note 11's claims.
- **Orby's own evolution as a security surface** — the tool-call quality gate (note 12 P0-1), the "AI-use policy" (make this concrete: what are Orby's actual refusal rules, persona guardrails, and output-sanitization behavior today, and where would a determined prompt-injection attempt still get through? Note 11 flags `/api/orby-comment` as unauthenticated — is that still true, and is that the only gap?).
- **Sanity safety net** — the user's own words were "no one can change information." Map this precisely: note 11/12 flag `SANITY_API_TOKEN` being passed as a `browserToken` in `src/sanity/lib/live.ts` and says it must be Viewer-scoped (read-only) in the Sanity dashboard. Verify current token scope is checkable (it may require a dashboard check the user has to do, similar to the Cerebras billing check in note 12 — if so, write it as an explicit numbered verification step, not a code TODO). Confirm there is no live mutation path from the public app.
- **Cloudflare-level protection — resolve an ambiguity, don't assume.** The user asked for "a literal firewall that prevents hackers" on Cloudflare specifically. `src/lib/request-guards.ts` references a Cloudflare host allowlist and reads `cf-connecting-ip`. Before writing anything about "Cloudflare WAF rules," determine whether Cloudflare is actually the edge/proxy in front of `anantgupta.dev` (check DNS/nameservers for the domain, ask the user if dashboard access isn't available to you) or whether the app is only opportunistically reading Cloudflare-shaped headers while Vercel is the real edge — in which case the actionable firewall is Vercel's own WAF / Attack Challenge Mode (already flagged as dashboard-unverified in notes 11/12), and the prompt should say so plainly rather than writing Cloudflare-specific rules for infrastructure that may not exist. If Cloudflare genuinely is in front, research concrete WAF rule recommendations (rate-limiting rules, bot-fight mode, managed rulesets) suited to a Next.js/Vercel origin behind Cloudflare.
- **Rate-limit protections, "perfected."** Note 12 already did the capacity math (Groq's 1,000 req/day is shared, not per-IP) and flagged Upstash fail-open as an unresolved P2. Turn "perfected" into concrete: should fail-open become fail-closed (or a capped fail-open) on Upstash outage, and what's the tradeoff for a portfolio (availability vs. abuse risk during a Redis outage)? Give a recommendation with reasoning, not just the question.
- **AI-use policy as a written artifact.** Beyond code guardrails, is there (or should there be) an actual short published policy — what Orby will/won't do, what data it uses, how it's grounded — that ties into the still-unshipped `/privacy` page from the SEO note's Phase 4? If these two gaps (AI-use policy, privacy page) are actually the same missing artifact, say so and don't spec them twice.

Also re-verify note 12's P0-0 (Cerebras billing) is either resolved or still the literal first action item — do not let a stale "TODO" survive into your new prompt if the user has already handled it; if you can't tell, ask.

**Deliverable:** a new note, likely `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/security/[next number] - Security Hardening Implementation Prompt - [date].md` (or wherever fits the existing `security/` numbering best — use your judgment, follow the folder's existing convention, don't invent a new structure). It should read as ONE cohesive, orderable task list a coding agent can execute — Clerk, Sanity token scope, Cloudflare/Vercel WAF (resolved, not hedged), rate-limit fail-open decision, Orby's AI-use policy and quality gate — with the Sonnet-5-t 11 and 12 as background, don't duplicate their verified-status tables.

---

## Topic A — SEO Fundamentals → AEO Evolution (do this second)

The existing note 01 is a good strategy document but is explicitly phased 5A through 5E across five different concerns at once. The user wants ONE narrow, sequenced execution prompt: ship the SEO basics first, then evolve into AEO — not a menu of options.

Re-read note 01's "Current Status" table (what's shipped vs. not: `metadataBase`, `sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`, `/privacy`, structured data — all currently missing per that table) and its "Ranking #1 for 'Anant Gupta'" section (real SERP competition findings — the bare name has high-authority competition from unrelated people; "Anant Gupta portfolio/developer/UMN" is the realistic near-term win) and its award-directory table (Siteinspire/Godly/Bestfolios/Show HN recommended now, Awwwards/CSS Design Awards held for later). Re-verify against the live repo that these are still accurate (things may have shipped since).

**Deliverable:** a new note, likely `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/AEO & SEO/02 - SEO to AEO Implementation Prompt - [date].md`, structured as a strict sequence:
1. **SEO basics, in build order** — the concrete, smallest-diff path to ship `metadataBase`, canonical URL, `sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`, the `/privacy` page (note the dependency on Topic B's AI-use-policy content if that's the same artifact), and JSON-LD structured data (Person/ProfilePage/WebSite/SoftwareApplication — note 01 already drafted these blocks, verify and reuse rather than re-deriving).
2. **Then AEO evolution** — only once the basics are real: the AI-crawler robots policy (note 01's OAI-SearchBot/PerplexityBot/ClaudeBot table), llms.txt, and the entity-building/award-directory moves — sequenced as "do this only after step 1 ships," not in parallel with it.

Same rigor as Topic B: Sonnet-5-tuned, literal, numbered, self-verifying, cross-linked to note 01 rather than duplicating it.

---

## Constraints on you, this session

- Read-only on `src/`, `next.config.ts`, everything under the app repo. Write-only to the Jarvis vault.
- Do not silently resolve an open question you find in existing notes (e.g., anything still marked "open" or "unverified") — either verify it against the repo/dashboard yourself and say what you found, or surface it back to the user as a decision, the way prior open questions in this effort were handled (Projects auto-play scope, the logo/favicon glow claim) — don't guess.
- Don't re-litigate locked decisions you find in the existing notes (e.g., Product Hunt and paid backlink vendors are already explicitly out of scope per note 01; Agent-Callable Orby via MCP is already explicitly deferred) — respect them.
- When you hit a genuine judgment call only the user can make, use it — don't stall, don't guess silently either.
- Follow the Claude Sonnet 5 prompting guide (https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/[REDACTED]) for both output prompts: front-load full context in one turn, be literal about scope, give a concrete self-verification checklist, don't leave "make it better" vagueness where a concrete spec is possible.

Report back when both notes are written: what you verified vs. what had drifted since notes 11/12/01 were written, and any decision you had to kick back to the user.

Why this shape: it forces the new session through the same discipline that caught real bugs in this session (verify-before-cite, resolve-don't-silently-decide), it names the exact ambiguity you should watch for (Cloudflare vs. Vercel WAF — that's genuinely unresolved and worth flagging up front rather than letting a new session assume), and it defines "done" as a Cursor-executable prompt, not another strategy essay — which is precisely what you said the existing notes are missing.

## Claude

That's the exact same instruction block I already executed a few turns back — both deliverables exist:

- `security/06 - Security Hardening Implementation Prompt - 2026-09-05.md`
- `AEO & SEO/02 - SEO to AEO Implementation Prompt - 2026-09-05.md`

And the note text got cut off mid-sentence ("...with the Sonnet-5-t 11 and 12 as background...") the same way it did the first time, so this looks like an accidental resend rather than a new ask.

More importantly, real progress has happened since I wrote those, worth knowing before you send anything else:

- **SEO Phase 1 has shipped.** `AEO & SEO/02` now has a new "Phase 1 Completion — 2026-09-05 (Cursor session)" section appended, reporting Tasks 1–6 done and the gate checks passed.
- **Security Tasks 3 and 6 have shipped in code**, per the diff your system just showed me: `orby-comment/route.ts` now has the HMAC `verifyToken` check (Task 3) and the structured `orby-comment.ratelimit.fail_open` log line (Task 6). I'm treating that as intentional, not reverting it.
- **Security Task 7 (AI-use policy content) has not run yet** — `security/06`'s placeholder heading is still empty (unchanged version hash from when I wrote it). If the SEO session's Task 3 needed that content for the `/privacy` page, check its completion note for which fallback path it actually took, since it may have already sourced those facts directly from code instead of waiting.

Given that, re-running the whole "read everything, verify, write two prompts" task from scratch would just regenerate what's already there and risks stepping on the completion notes that are now appended to it. What do you actually want next — a status audit of what's shipped vs. still open across both, a round of *new* implementation prompts (Phase 2 AEO, or the remaining security tasks 0/1/4/5), or something else?
