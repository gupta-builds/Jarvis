# AEO and SEO strategy

## You

<timestamp>Saturday, Sep 5, 2026, 12:31 AM (UTC-5)</timestamp>
<user_query>
ROLE & MODE
Research + vault-documentation session. Cursor. Your deliverable is a well-structured Obsidian
note (or set of notes) written into the Jarvis vault — not code. You may read the portfolio repo
to verify what's actually shipped, but do not edit application source.

WHY THIS SESSION EXISTS
`20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/AEO & SEO/00 - Agent-Ready Infrastructure Build Plan.md`
already exists (created 2026-07-29) with a real 5-phase plan (metadata exports, sitemap.ts/
robots.ts, OpenGraph/Twitter tags, a privacy policy page, then an AEO audit) plus a deferred
"Agent-Callable Orby via MCP" idea. This is not a green-field research task — it's "verify what
of that plan actually shipped in the ~5 weeks since, then go much deeper" on both classic SEO and
the newer AEO (answer-engine optimization) side, specifically aimed at the site being surfaced
and recommended — by Google AND by AI assistants a person might ask — as the best portfolio,
best AI agent/lab project, best AI chatbot demo, and (the more unusual angles) as a memorable
"AI pet/companion" (Orby) and as a legitimate recruiter-screening tool.

READ IN THIS ORDER

1. `AEO & SEO/00 - Agent-Ready Infrastructure Build Plan.md` — full read (you likely already
   have the gist, but read it directly for exact wording). Note its "Market Context" stats
   (agents are 51% of traffic, AI Overviews cutting publisher traffic 25%) — verify these are
   still the best available figures or find more current ones; this data ages fast.
2. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/architecture/01-nextjs-routes.md` — WARNING: this is a
   graphify auto-generated snapshot from an old commit (~2026-06-12), already stale by the time
   AEO/00 was written in July. Do not trust its "zero metadata exports" claim — check
   `src/app/` directly, right now, for `metadata`/`generateMetadata`, `sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`,
   and OpenGraph tags. The repo has had extensive uncommitted work recently; some of Phase 1–4
   may already be done.
3. `20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/chatbot/01-api-route.md` — the existing Orby endpoint the
   deferred "Agent-Callable Orby" idea would extend.
4. In `60_Claude/20_Distilled_Notes/Sources - Plan/Web Ingestion Implementation.md` — this file
   is huge and covers the user's entire vault, not just the portfolio. Find and read only the
   "Agent-Ready Infrastructure (AEO + MCP) - BUILD" section — the original proposal AEO/00 was
   built from.
5. In `60_Claude/20_Distilled_Notes/Sources - Plan/00_Execution.md` — search for the resolved
   verdict on that same Agent-Ready Infrastructure item.
6. `60_Claude/05_Clippings/Web/Security/App Privacy Policy Generator.md` — the tool AEO/00's
   Phase 4 already picked; confirm it's still the right call before citing it again.

CROSS-SESSION BOUNDARY
A parallel Cursor session is reconciling Orby's security/rate-limiting posture and will make any
real go/no-go call on exposing "Agent-Callable Orby via MCP" — that involves a real security-model
change (a machine-callable endpoint is a different threat model than a rate-limited chat widget).
Your job here is to document the AEO *case* for it (why it would help discoverability, what
official patterns exist for it) and flag the dependency — not to decide or implement it.

NEW RESEARCH TO DO — go find current, official-source information; SEO/AEO practice and platform
crawler behavior change fast enough that pre-training knowledge is not reliable here. Cite sources.

- Technical SEO for a Next.js personal portfolio: structured data (schema.org `Person`,
  `ProfilePage`, `SoftwareApplication` for the projects, `FAQPage` for Orby-answerable questions),
  canonical URLs, Google Search Console + Bing Webmaster Tools verification and sitemap
  submission, and how much Core Web Vitals actually weighs into ranking today.
- AEO / getting cited by AI answer engines specifically: the `llms.txt` convention, what
  ChatGPT/Perplexity/Google AI Overviews/Claude actually look for structurally, crawler
  user-agents to explicitly allow in `robots.ts` (GPTBot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot, Google-Extended,
  etc.), and writing page copy as directly-extractable factual sentences rather than marketing copy.
- Realistic backlink/domain-authority moves for a solo student portfolio — no paid SEO services.
  Check what's already available in this vault before inventing generic advice: GitHub README
  cross-links, `10_Areas/Career/Hackathon/Hackathons.md` (devpost/hackathon project listings),
  and any dev.to/Hashnode/LinkedIn presence already documented elsewhere in the vault.
- Specifically research how to build toward each of these positioning/query angles — treat them
  as content and structured-data targets, not literal keywords to stuff: "best portfolio site,"
  "AI agent portfolio," "AI lab," "AI chatbot" (Orby as the concrete proof), "AI pet/companion"
  (Orby's character angle — unusual but worth researching how mascot/character AI products get
  discovered and shared), and "recruiter screening tool" (positioning Orby as something a
  recruiter can actually interrogate about the candidate).
- Current best practice for exposing an MCP server or agent-callable API from a personal site
  (for the deferred Agent-Callable Orby idea) — document what you find; do not decide on it.

BEFORE WRITING THE FINAL NOTE — ASK ME QUESTIONS
At minimum: what is the real production domain; is Google Search Console / Bing Webmaster /
any analytics already set up (and if so, what does current traffic/impression data already show —
that would change the whole strategy from "starting cold" to "optimizing"); do you want a real
decision surfaced on the Agent-Callable-Orby idea or should it stay explicitly deferred here too;
which of the positioning angles (best portfolio / AI agent / AI lab / AI chatbot / AI pet /
screening tool) matters most to prioritize first; and whether any paid or semi-paid moves (a
custom domain if not already owned, a Product Hunt style launch) are actually in scope or off
the table for a solo student project.

DELIVERABLE
Extend the `AEO & SEO/` folder with a new note (propose the exact filename to me, e.g.
`01 - SEO & AEO Discoverability Strategy.md`) containing: a verified status check of AEO/00's
Phases 1–4 against live code; a structured-data spec (concrete JSON-LD to add, not just "add
structured data"); a crawler/robots.ts checklist; a content strategy mapped to each positioning
angle above; and a phased action plan that picks up from AEO/00's Phase 5 onward. Cite every
external claim with its source. Follow this vault's existing note conventions (frontmatter,
`[[wikilinks]]`, an `## Evidence` section) and cross-link back to `AEO & SEO/00` rather than
duplicating it.
</user_query>

## Cursor

I’ll treat this as a research and vault-documentation task, not an app-code task. I’ll first load the relevant Obsidian workflow guidance, then read the specified notes and inspect the portfolio code read-only to verify what has actually shipped.

[REDACTED]

I’ve loaded the vault-search workflow. Next I’m reading the exact source notes the strategy must build on, then I’ll compare the old infrastructure plan against the current `src/app` implementation without changing source files.

[REDACTED]

The existing plan confirms the original July claim was based on an old route snapshot, so I’m now checking the live app files directly for metadata, sitemap, robots, OpenGraph/Twitter fields, and privacy-policy routing.

[REDACTED]

Live code already shows partial progress: `src/app/(portfolio)/layout.tsx` now has `generateMetadata()` with OpenGraph/Twitter fields, while `sitemap.ts` and `robots.ts` do not appear in `src/app`. I’m reading the route files and site settings query next so the status check can be precise.

[REDACTED]

I’m moving into current-source research now. I’ll favor official docs for implementation-sensitive claims, and separate platform-confirmed behavior from community conventions like `llms.txt` where official adoption is limited.

[REDACTED]

The market-context numbers have aged: the stronger current Imperva/Thales source says automated traffic reached 53% in 2025, and AI-driven bot attacks rose 12.5x year over year. I’m continuing to pin crawler and structured-data claims to official platform documentation.

[REDACTED]

A useful nuance is emerging: Google’s official guidance says AI Overviews/AI Mode use normal Search indexing and snippets, and explicitly says `llms.txt` is not needed for Google Search. That does not make `llms.txt` useless for developer-facing agents, but it should be framed as a lightweight courtesy file, not a ranking lever.

[REDACTED]

[REDACTED]

For the vault-side backlink context, I’m checking what’s already documented before recommending any external presence work. This should keep the strategy grounded in GitHub, hackathon listings, and any existing writing/social footprint rather than generic SEO advice.

[REDACTED]

The repo’s Sanity query shape is enough to design truthful JSON-LD without inventing CMS fields: profile social links already include GitHub, LinkedIn, Medium, dev.to, YouTube, and Stack Overflow; projects expose title, slug, tagline, summary, category, live URL, GitHub URL, and technologies.

[REDACTED]

The repo itself documents `anantgupta.dev` and `www.anantgupta.dev` behind Cloudflare to Vercel, but I’ll still ask you to confirm the production canonical domain before writing because canonical URLs and Search Console properties depend on the exact choice.

[REDACTED]

One repository inconsistency to note for the future note: `README.md` still mentions local NDJSON fallback content, but the current file search did not find `src/lib/localContent.ts`. I’ll keep that as context only, not part of the SEO/AEO deliverable unless it affects structured-data implementation.

[REDACTED]

The vault now has a real hackathon playbook, not the old stub, and it explicitly recommends post-hackathon LinkedIn posts, judge tags, Loom walkthroughs, and clean GitHub repos. I’m reading the GitHub-profile notes next because those are the most realistic “authority” levers for a solo portfolio.

[REDACTED]

I have enough research to draft the note after your answers. Before I write anything into Jarvis, I need the strategy inputs that change canonical URLs, measurement assumptions, Orby’s treatment, and launch scope.

[REDACTED]

Thanks, that settles the strategy frame: canonical `https://anantgupta.dev`, Google Search Console exists, Orby MCP stays deferred/security-gated, free-only distribution, and the first positioning cluster is AI agent / AI lab / AI chatbot. I’ll turn that into a concise implementation plan for the Jarvis note before writing it.

Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

## Cursor

I'll implement the plan by drafting the Jarvis note from the verified code status and research already gathered, then write it into the vault and review it for completeness.

## You

<dynamic_tool_catalog>
These dynamic tool namespaces were available when this conversation started. Availability may have changed, so use `GetDynamicTools` to check current state before calling `CallDynamicTool`.

<dynamic_tool_namespaces>
<namespace name="cursor-ide-browser" tools="browser_navigate, browser_snapshot, browser_click, browser_mouse_click_xy, browser_type, browser_fill, browser_select_option, browser_press_key, browser_scroll, browser_drag, browser_get_bounding_box, browser_highlight, browser_tabs, browser_cdp, browser_take_screenshot, browser_lock" namespaceUseInstructions="The cursor-ide-browser MCP server provides a Cursor-owned browser tab plus a raw Chrome DevTools Protocol command tool.

CORE WORKFLOW:
1. Start by understanding the user's goal and what success looks like on the page.
2. Use browser_tabs with action "list" to inspect open tabs and URLs before acting.
3. Use browser_navigate to create or navigate the target tab. Omit the position parameter for background automation so focus is preserved.
4. Use browser_lock before longer automation on an existing tab, then browser_lock with action "unlock" when finished.
5. Use browser_snapshot for accessibility context and browser_take_screenshot for visual verification.
6. Use browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill, browser_select_option, browser_press_key, browser_scroll, and browser_drag for page interactions.
7. Use browser_highlight and browser_get_bounding_box for visual grounding and coordinate diagnostics.
8. Use browser_cdp for page inspection, profiling, runtime evaluation, DOM/CSS queries, and performance data.

AVOID RABBIT HOLES:
1. Do not repeat the same failing action more than once without new evidence such as a fresh snapshot, a different ref, a changed page state, or a clear new hypothesis.
2. IMPORTANT: If four attempts fail or progress stalls, stop acting and report what you observed, what blocked progress, and the most likely next step.
3. Prefer gathering evidence over brute force. If the page is confusing, use browser_snapshot, browser_take_screenshot, or CDP inspection before trying more actions.
4. If you encounter a blocker such as login, passkey/manual user interaction, permissions, captchas, destructive confirmations, missing data, or an unexpected state, stop and report it instead of improvising repeated actions.
5. Do not get stuck in wait-action-wait loops. Every retry should be justified by something newly observed.

CRITICAL - Lock/unlock workflow:
1. browser_lock requires an existing browser tab - you CANNOT call browser_lock with action: "lock" before browser_navigate
2. Correct order: browser_navigate -> browser_lock({ action: "lock" }) -> (interactions) -> browser_lock({ action: "unlock" })
3. If a browser tab already exists (check with browser_tabs list), call browser_lock with action: "lock" FIRST before any interactions
4. Only call browser_lock with action: "unlock" when completely done with ALL browser operations for this turn

IMPORTANT - Waiting strategy:
When waiting for page changes, prefer short CDP polling loops with Runtime.evaluate, DOM queries, Page lifecycle signals, or browser_snapshot checks rather than a single long wait.

CDP USAGE:
- Use browser_cdp with a DevTools Protocol method and params object, for example Runtime.evaluate, DOM.getDocument, CSS.getComputedStyleForNode, Profiler.start/stop, Performance.getMetrics, Log.enable, and Network.enable.
- Do not use browser_cdp with CDP Input.* methods. They are denied because they are focus-sensitive in Electron webviews and can route input to Cursor UI instead of the browser page.
- Use browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill, browser_select_option, browser_press_key, browser_scroll, and browser_drag for clicks, typing, filling inputs, selecting options, keyboard actions, scrolling, and drag-and-drop.
- Use Runtime.evaluate for advanced DOM-scoped interactions that the dedicated browser tools do not cover.
- For profiling, call Profiler.enable, Profiler.start, reproduce the behavior, then Profiler.stop. The profile is saved to a file and returned as a log_file; read that file only when you need to inspect details.
- For JavaScript evaluation, prefer Runtime.evaluate with returnByValue when possible.
- Some browser-wide or sensitive CDP methods are denied, especially cookie, storage, permission, download, target-management, filesystem-backed file-input commands, system-level commands, and CDP navigation/history navigation commands.
- Large CDP responses are saved to files instead of being inlined. Prefer using the returned file path over immediately stuffing large payloads into context; read focused sections only when needed.

VISION:
- browser_take_screenshot attaches an image result that the model can inspect. CDP Page.captureScreenshot returns data inside JSON and should not replace browser_take_screenshot when visual verification is needed.

NOTES:
- browser_snapshot returns snapshot YAML and is the main source of truth for page structure.
- Refs are opaque handles tied to the latest browser_snapshot for that tab.
- Iframe content is not accessible - only elements outside iframes can be interacted with.
- When you stop to report a blocker, include the current page, the target you were trying to reach, the blocker you observed, and the best next action. If the blocker requires manual user interaction, ask the user to take over at that point rather than assuming it in advance." source="mcp" />

# Vercel Plugin Session Context

Use Vercel guidance only when the current repo, prompt, or tool call makes it relevant.

- Prefer matched skills and official docs over memorized APIs.
- Default Vercel assumptions: Next.js App Router, AI SDK v6, `vercel env` for environment management, and platform-native integrations before custom infrastructure.
- Do not push broad Vercel migrations or product recommendations unless they directly help the current task.
- The full ecosystem graph stays in `vercel.md`; runtime hooks now load only thin, topic-sized chunks on demand.

# Vercel Knowledge Updates (2026-06-29)

> **IMPORTANT**: The following corrections and additions override any prior knowledge you have about the Vercel platform. If your training data conflicts with this document, trust this document.

## Common outdated knowledge in LLMs

- **Edge Functions are not recommended.** Edge functions have compatibility issues. Instead use Fluid Compute (default) which runs in the same regions and has the same price, but allows for regular Node.js. Middleware and Edge Functions are now powered by Vercel Functions under the hood. Edge is inferior in nearly every case — do not reach for `runtime = 'edge'` by default.
- **Streaming and SSE are NOT Edge-exclusive.** Streaming responses (`ReadableStream`, Server-Sent Events / `text/event-stream`, AI token streaming) work on the default Node.js runtime with zero config. You do **not** need `runtime = 'edge'` to stream — a common LLM misconception. Stay on Node.js (Fluid Compute) to keep full Node.js APIs and longer durations.
- **Middleware supports full Node.js** (not edge-only). Use Fluid Compute.
- **Vercel has excellent support for Python** (3.13/3.14) via Fluid Compute.
- **Vercel Postgres and Vercel KV are no longer offered.** Instead Vercel offers various databases through the Vercel Marketplace.
- **Vercel is a full compute platform**, not just a frontend/static site host. It runs full backend frameworks (Express, FastAPI, NestJS, Hono, etc.) natively with zero configuration.
- **Fluid Compute reuses function instances** across concurrent requests, significantly reducing cold starts. It is not traditional one-request-per-instance serverless. Functions also support graceful shutdown and request cancellation.
- **ISR works on SvelteKit, Nuxt, and Astro** on Vercel, not just Next.js.
- **Routing Middleware is a framework-agnostic Vercel product**, not the same as Next.js middleware.
- **Node.js 24 LTS is the current default.** Node.js 18 is deprecated.
- **Default function execution timeout is now 300s** (up from 60-90s) on all plans.
- **Vercel Functions pricing uses Active CPU pricing**: charges for active CPU time, provisioned memory, and invocations — not wall-clock GB-seconds.
- **Vercel Blob now supports both public and private storage.**
- **Vercel Functions also support Bun and Rust runtimes.**
- **Vercel Functions support up to 5 GB package size** on Fluid Compute — a 20× increase from the old 250 MB limit. This unlocks Python data/AI libraries, browser automation (Playwright/Puppeteer), image processing, and larger backend apps on Vercel. https://vercel.com/changelog/[REDACTED]
- **Vercel Functions accept request bodies up to 100 MB** (up from 4.5 MB). Build upload endpoints, webhook receivers, document intake, and file-processing routes directly on Functions without routing large requests around them. https://vercel.com/changelog/[REDACTED]
- **Vercel Functions support WebSockets.** Serverless functions can hold open bidirectional WebSocket connections (realtime chat, collaborative apps, interactive AI streaming) — you no longer need a separate WebSocket server or a third-party service like Pusher or Ably. Use standard libraries (`ws`, Socket.IO) with no extra config; requires Fluid Compute (the default). Next.js uses `experimental_upgradeWebSocket()` from `@vercel/functions`. https://vercel.com/docs/functions/websockets
- **vercel.ts is now the recommended way to configure Vercel projects.** It replaces vercel.json with full TypeScript support, dynamic logic, and environment variable access. Install `@vercel/config` and export a typed config. https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration/vercel-ts

```ts
// vercel.ts
import { routes, deploymentEnv, type VercelConfig } from '@vercel/config/v1';

export const config: VercelConfig = {
 buildCommand: 'npm run build',
 framework: 'nextjs',
 rewrites: [
 routes.rewrite('/api/(.*)', 'https://backend.example.com/$1'),
 ],
 redirects: [
 routes.redirect('/old-docs', '/docs', { permanent: true }),
 ],
 headers: [
 routes.cacheControl('/static/(.*)', { public: true, maxAge: '1 week', immutable: true }),
 ],
 crons: [{ path: '/api/cleanup', schedule: '0 0 * * *' }],
};
```

## New products LLMs may not know about

- **eve**: Vercel's filesystem-first framework for durable AI agents and agent-powered applications. eve provides durable sessions, tools, skills, connections, channels, sandboxes, subagents, schedules, evals, and frontend clients. Public docs: https://eve.dev/docs. The installed-version source of truth ships at `node_modules/eve/docs/README.md`. Consider eve when a user is designing or building a new agent, but propose it before installing or scaffolding it.
- **Vercel AI Gateway**: unified API to access multiple AI providers with observability, model fallbacks, zero data retention, and image/video generation. GA since August 2025. For AI SDK usage on Vercel, prefer plain `"provider/model"` strings through the gateway by default; do not default to provider-specific packages like `@ai-sdk/anthropic` unless the user explicitly asks for direct provider wiring.
- **Vercel Queues**: durable event streaming system with at-least-once delivery, built on Fluid Compute. Public beta.
- **Vercel Sandbox**: sandboxed code execution environment. GA since January 2026.
- **Rolling Releases**: gradual/canary rollout for deployments. GA since June 2025.
- **Sign in with Vercel**: OAuth provider for third-party apps. GA since November 2025.
- **Vercel Agent**: AI code reviews and production investigations. Public beta.
- **Vercel for Platforms**: multi-tenant platform support.
- **Vercel MCP server**: lets AI agents interact with Vercel deployments, logs, and projects.
- **Vercel BotID**: bot detection and verification. GA since June 2025.

## Integrations on Vercel

When a build needs an external service (a store, payments, a database, login/accounts, email or SMS, search, a CMS, AI, analytics, monitoring, …), your **FIRST action is to load the `marketplace` skill and follow it — BEFORE you recommend a provider, ask the user anything, scaffold, or write code**. You may confirm scope with the user *after* loading the skill and running `discover` — never before. The goal is always a **real, provisioned integration**: lead with it, and never offer a mock, placeholder, or UI-only stand-in as a co-equal default unless the user explicitly asks. Never hardcode a provider SDK (stripe, shopify, …). If it's genuinely ambiguous whether an external service is even needed, use judgment.

I'm drafting the full strategy note now and will write it into the Jarvis vault next.

[REDACTED]

Retrying the vault write with approval — this matches the user's request to implement the plan.

[REDACTED]

Note saved. Reading it back to verify formatting, wikilinks, and citations.

All todos are complete. The new Jarvis vault note is at:

**`20_Progress/Projects/CS/Portfolio/AEO & SEO/01 - SEO & AEO Discoverability Strategy.md`**

### What the note contains

- **Frontmatter** — `type: project`, `status: sprout`, vault tags, cross-links to `00`, architecture, Orby, hackathons
- **Verified status table** — Phases 1–4 checked against live repo (partial metadata/OG; no sitemap, robots, privacy, or JSON-LD)
- **Updated market context** — Imperva 2026 stats (53% automated traffic), Google AEO guidance, `llms.txt` framing
- **Technical SEO baseline** — `metadataBase`, canonical, GSC export action, CWV targets, Bing/IndexNow
- **Structured data spec** — Concrete JSON-LD for `ProfilePage`/`Person`, `WebSite`, Orby `SoftwareApplication`, project templates, cautious `FAQPage` note
- **Robots/crawler checklist** — Googlebot, Google-Extended, OAI-SearchBot, GPTBot, PerplexityBot, Claude bots, etc.
- **Content strategy** — AI agent/lab/chatbot first, then recruiter, portfolio SEO, companion angle, AI lab
- **Free distribution moves** — GitHub README, LinkedIn, hackathons, Sanity social fields
- **Agent-Callable Orby** — Explicitly deferred, security-gated, MCP OAuth spec cited
- **Phase 5+ action plan** — 20 ordered steps from infrastructure through measurement to Phase 6 block
- **`llms.txt` starter draft**
- **Evidence** — Vault wikilinks + external citations (Google, OpenAI, Perplexity, Anthropic, Bing, Imperva, MCP)

### Constraints honored

- No portfolio source code edited
- Plan file not touched
- Cross-links to `00` instead of duplicating it
- Canonical domain: `https://anantgupta.dev`
- GSC assumed set up; Bing WMT flagged as unconfirmed

**Note:** Vault read-back timed out (likely note size), but `vault_write` returned OK. Open the note in Obsidian to confirm rendering — especially wikilinks with special characters in paths like `App Privacy Policy Generator`.

**Suggested next step from the note:** Export GSC impressions/clicks/queries, then implement `sitemap.ts` + `robots.ts` + `metadataBase`.
