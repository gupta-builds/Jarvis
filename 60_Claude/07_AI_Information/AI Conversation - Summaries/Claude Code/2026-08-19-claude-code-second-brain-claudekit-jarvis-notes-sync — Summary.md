# Conversation Summary — Second-brain-claudekit Jarvis Notes Sync

## What Was Decided
- Every Jarvis note tracking second-brain-claudekit's structure would be verified against the *real* WSL repo directly (`//wsl$/Ubuntu/.../second-brain-claudekit`), not against the Windows mirror (which only syncs `.claude/{agents,commands,hooks,settings.json}` + root `CLAUDE.md`) and not against the base-layout session's own self-report, per an explicit "verify before write" instruction that flagged a prior prompt-injection-shaped anomaly as reason for suspicion.
- `agents/`, `commands/`, `hooks/` top-level folders: confirmed genuinely repurposed from flat draft-then-promote staging to per-destination-project staging, all three empty on disk. (A `docs/<Project>/` sibling was believed to exist at this point — later corrected 2026-08-20 to have been a naming error for `_docs/`, never real.)
- CPR commands (`compress`/`preserve`/`resume`) verdict confirmed **blend**, backed by a real test transcript, not just a `VERDICT.md` claim.
- The 15-file native-scaffold relocation (4 agents/8 commands/3 hooks) confirmed present at `tested-tools/{agents,commands,hooks}/native-scaffold/`.
- `instructions/` discovery-pass count corrected: repo docs claimed 27 files across 19 repos; direct count was **28** — a real off-by-one in the repo's own discovery pass, caught rather than transcribed.
- Conversation-capture health independently re-verified by reading `00 - Capture Health.md` directly rather than trusting the repo's citation of it — both Windows and WSL showed consecutive OK/exit-0 runs, so the matching `Gaps.md` entry was closed on real evidence.
- Terminology drift (`tested-skills` → `tested-tools`) fixed throughout `Tool Map.md`.

## What Changed
Seven Jarvis notes updated in one pass, each against independently verified repo state: `Tool Map.md` (terminology fix, CPR row, native-scaffold batch row, `parked (future)` stage definition), `Log.md` (new dated entry), `What Agents.md`/`What Commands.md`/`What Hooks.md` (rewrote stale flat-staging framing; `What Skills.md` checked and confirmed already accurate, left alone), `Folder Map.md` (added the verified new structure), `Notes Map.md` (fixed stale sync-script and terminology references), `Claude Code.md` (applied an already-identified command/MCP table diff), `Gaps.md` (closed the WSL capture-reliability entry, left the Cowork entry open since the dashboard doesn't cover it).

## Tool Use Detail
Opened with `Bash` directory listings of both the Windows mirror (`find`/`ls`, confirming it only holds `.claude/*` + `CLAUDE.md`, exactly as `Setup.md`'s own "what's NOT synced" section says) and the real WSL repo via the `//wsl$/Ubuntu/...` UNC path — establishing early that the mirror could not answer most of the leads on its own, so direct WSL access became the verification source of truth for the rest of the session. Followed with 23 `Read` calls pulling the actual content of `VERDICT.md`, test-log transcripts, `_docs/Repo-Map.md`, `_docs/How to/*`, `Gaps.md`, and the real `00 - Capture Health.md` dashboard — each claim from the base-layout session's self-report checked against one of these before being trusted. Once verification was complete, 21 `Edit` calls updated the seven Jarvis notes listed above, patching by section rather than rewriting whole files, followed by a final formatting pass (checked for stray blank lines and `---` inside bodies, consistent with this vault's write-contract rules) and one last `Read`-back of the most heavily edited file to confirm it rendered correctly. No failed tool calls; no edits outside the seven notes named in the task.

## Important Context
This session ran for over 20 hours of wall-clock time (`started_at` 2026-08-19T14:29, `ended_at` 2026-08-20T10:32) across only 8 turns — consistent with a long-running background/overnight session rather than rapid back-and-forth. It is the direct predecessor to the 2026-08-20 adversarial-review round that caught the `docs/` vs `_docs/` naming error this session's own instructions repeated as fact (line 69 of the raw note: "a new `docs/<Project>/`" — inherited uncritically from the base-layout session's self-report despite the session's own stated ground rule to verify every claim independently). That's a real instance of the failure mode this whole review exercise exists to catch: verification was thorough for most claims but missed one because it wasn't flagged as suspicious by the source material itself.

## Source Claims (Quoted From Transcript)
> "The Windows mirror at `20_Progress/AI/Claude Code/second-brain-claudekit/` only syncs `.claude/{agents,commands,hooks,settings.json}` + root `CLAUDE.md`... it couldn't have verified most of the leads. I instead reached the real repo directly."
> "Caught false/off: `instructions/` is **28** files, not the claimed 27 (repeated twice in the repo's own docs — a genuine off-by-one in their discovery pass, not just a lead to transcribe)."

## Inferred Claims (Distiller Interpretation)
The session's closing summary presents its verification as complete and its output as fully reconciled with real repo state. Cross-checked against the 2026-08-20 adversarial review (this same day): that later review found the `docs/<Project>/` claim this session repeated was itself false, meaning this session's "verify before write" discipline had a real gap — it verified the leads flagged as uncertain in its prompt, but not every factual claim embedded in the prompt's own framing.

## Open Questions
- Whether other unflagged claims from a task prompt (not just this one's `docs/` example) have slipped through this same verification pattern elsewhere in the vault — worth a spot-check next time a similar "verify the prior session" task runs.

## Follow-Up Actions
- None outstanding from this session specifically — its `docs/` error was already corrected by the 2026-08-20 round (see [[20_Progress/Projects/AI Use/Claude Kit/Log]]'s `[2026-08-20]` entry).

## Should Be Promoted?
No — this is a working session log, not a durable insight. The one reusable lesson (verify claims embedded in a task prompt's own framing, not just claims flagged as uncertain) is worth carrying forward as review-process guidance, not as a standalone evergreen note.
