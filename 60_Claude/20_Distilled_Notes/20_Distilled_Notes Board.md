# Distilled Notes

Evergreen knowledge artifacts extracted from conversations and sources.

## Notes

```dataview
TABLE created, status, type, next
FROM "60_Claude/20_Distilled_Notes"
WHERE type = "evergreen" OR type = "concept"
SORT file.mtime DESC
```

## Workflow

Claude creates distilled notes here when:
- A conversation produces reusable knowledge
- A concept deserves its own page
- Multiple sources converge on an insight
