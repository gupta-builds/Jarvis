# AI Tools Weekly Review — 2026-W34
## Period Covered
2026-08-14 through 2026-08-20.
## Sources Reviewed
- [x] [[60_Claude/30_Reviews/AI/Toolkit/Tool log|Tool log]] — read in full; one row exists, dated 2026-08-19, added this same pass (see Findings)
- [x] [[20_Progress/AI/Claude Code/_All-Projects-Sync-Log|_All-Projects-Sync-Log]] — grepped for every line dated 2026-08-14 through 2026-08-20
- [x] [[20_Progress/AI/Claude Code/Write Log|Write Log]] — read in full; no entries fall in this period
- [x] Raw `AI Conversations/` session notes — read the 2026-08-19 second-brain-claudekit sync session in full (the Tool log's only source), plus spot-checked the most recent Windows and WSL Claude Code raw notes directly against `00 - Capture Health.md`'s claims
## What Ran This Period
| Skill/Command | Uses | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/export-ai-session` | 1 | Run 2026-08-20 (this pass) — first real exercise of the review pipeline since it was built 2026-08-11; distilled the 2026-08-19 session, wrote the Tool log's first row |
| (none — freeform verification task) | 1 | The 2026-08-19 session itself (34 Bash, 21 Edit, 23 Read, 2 Write, $19.67, ~20hr/8 turns) invoked no registered slash command — real work in this vault often doesn't route through a named skill, and the Tool log schema had no honest way to say that until this row forced the question |
## Sync & Capture Health
Sync runs this period, from `_All-Projects-Sync-Log.md` directly: **1740 OK / 0 failed / 0 skipped** — every line dated 2026-08-14 through 2026-08-20 ends `OK`; a grep for `CONFLICTS`, `FAIL`, `ERROR`, and `SKIP` across the same date range returned zero matches. Most recent entries run through 2026-08-20 12:49:34, minutes before this review — `ClaudeKit-Sync-All` is genuinely live, not just self-reporting live.
Capture health, independently spot-checked rather than taken from the dashboard alone: `00 - Capture Health.md` shows both Windows and WSL backfill's last 10 runs all `OK (exit 0)`, most recent at 2026-08-20T08:45–08:46 UTC, no failure streak on either. Cross-checked against real files, not just the dashboard's own claim: Windows produced a genuine new raw session note today (`Windows/Claude Code/Jarvis/08-20 Verify second-brain-claudekit adversarial review findings.md` — currently empty, a session still in progress, not a capture failure). WSL's newest real session note is still dated 2026-08-19 (`WSL/Claude Code/second-brain-claudekit/08-19 Stop hook errors with System.Runtime.Numerics-2.md`) — no WSL Claude Code session has run yet today, which is why the backfill has nothing new to report, not evidence the WSL hook is broken.
## Findings
- The Tool log held its empty schema from creation (2026-08-11) through this entire review period — the pipeline was fully designed and never run once until this pass forced it. An empty log for nine days straight is itself the finding, per the Standard's own instruction not to pad around it.
- [[20_Progress/AI/Claude Code/Write Log|Write Log.md]] has zero entries after 2026-07-30 — three full weeks silent, spanning this exact review period. In that time, real changes landed in the Claude Code tracking layer (the entire 2026-08-19 base-layout pass and the 2026-08-20 adversarial-review round, both logged in [[20_Progress/Projects/AI Use/Claude Kit/Log|Claude Kit/Log.md]] but not here) with no corresponding Write Log entry, even though Write Log's own header says it should capture exactly this class of change alongside Claude Kit/Log.md, not instead of it.
- The Tool log's `Skill/Command` row shape assumes every reviewed session invoked a nameable skill or command. The one real session available to review this pass did not — it was a long, freeform verification-and-edit task. The schema held up (the row got written honestly as "none"), but a review pass that only ever finds freeform sessions will produce a Tool log that says nothing about which skills are actually earning their keep, which is the log's whole stated purpose.
## Decided Fixes
None this pass. Nothing above reached the 100% clarity the Standard requires — see Open Questions.
## Open Questions
- Should [[20_Progress/AI/Claude Code/Write Log|Write Log.md]] keep being maintained as a separate file from [[20_Progress/Projects/AI Use/Claude Kit/Log|Claude Kit/Log.md]], or fold into it? Three weeks of silence while the overlapping log stayed current is real evidence the two-log split isn't holding up in practice, but whether that's a discipline gap (someone should just write the entries) or a sign the split itself is wrong isn't decided here.
- Should the Tool log's `Skill/Command` column keep accepting "none — freeform task" as a first-class value, or should freeform sessions get tagged with an informal category (e.g. "vault-curation," "verification") even without a literal slash command? Only one real data point exists; not enough to decide from yet.
- gbrain's embedding provider was decided this same week (OpenAI, 2026-08-20) but not yet wired in — worth checking next period whether it actually got executed or sat pending again.
## Next Period's Watch List
- Whether gbrain's OpenAI embedding key actually gets wired into `bun run src/cli.ts init` and `doctor` shows a real semantic-search health score, not just keyword/graph.
- Whether a real WSL Claude Code session runs and gets captured cleanly — today's zero WSL sessions is plausible but should not repeat as a pattern without becoming a real finding.
- Whether Write Log.md gets a next entry, or stays silent for a second consecutive review period — a second silent period is stronger evidence for folding it into Claude Kit/Log.md rather than fixing discipline.
- Whether the Tool log accumulates enough real rows (freeform or named) next period to say something meaningful about which skills are actually used, now that the pipeline has been exercised once for real.
