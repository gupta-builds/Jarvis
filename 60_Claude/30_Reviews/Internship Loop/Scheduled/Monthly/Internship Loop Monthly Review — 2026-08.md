# Internship Loop Monthly Review — 2026-08
## Period Covered
2026-08-01 through 2026-08-23. First run of this review — no prior period to compare against, so this pass also covers everything created before August that's still live in the pipeline.
## Sources Reviewed
- [x] `Programs/Serious/` and `Programs/Considering/` (full listing)
- [x] `Contacts/Each One/` (full listing, all subfolders)
- [x] `Tracker/Each One/` (full listing, all subfolders) and `Tracker/Tracker.md`
- [x] `20_Progress/Internship/Applying/Now.md` and `Applied/`
- [ ] `Preperation/Interviews/` — not opened; nothing in this pass reached that stage
## Pipeline Checklist
_Against [[Internship Pipeline]]'s own `Done When` list._
- [ ] **Every program actually pursued has a Program note, a Contacts note, and a Tracker note, all cross-linked — FAILS for 4 of 5 `Serious/` programs.** See Per-Program Trace.
- [x] No Applying note has gone more than a week without a Log entry while active — vacuously true, `20_Progress/Internship/Applying/` has no active Applying note yet (only `Applied/` exists, empty, and reference stubs `2026-HRT-Sophomore.md`/`AI Applying.md`/`Applications-to-Create.md`).
- [x] The Dashboard and the Kanban agree on what's currently in motion — both show nothing applied yet; `Tracker/Tracker.md`'s "Applied" lane is empty and `Applying/Now.md`'s dataview query has nothing to return, consistent with each other.
- [x] No `Ended/` Program note sits without a matching Applying note — `Programs/Serious/Ended/` and `Programs/Considering/Ended/` are both empty; nothing to check yet.
## Per-Program Trace
| Program | Noted | Researched | Created | Applied | Result | Stalled? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Appian (Considering) | 2026-07-25 | 2026-07-26 | 2026-07-26 | — | — | Trio complete and cross-linked (Program ↔ Contact ↔ Tracker all resolve). Tracker's `Next Action` says "no rush, applications aren't reviewed until August 2026" — written 2026-07-26, and it is now 2026-08-23. That reasoning is stale on its own terms, not re-checked since. |
| Deepgram (Serious) | — | — | 2026-07-29 (per [[Internship Pipeline]]'s Step 1 note) | — | — | **No Contacts note, no Tracker note exists anywhere in `Contacts/Each One/` or `Tracker/Each One/`.** Committed via the manual-web-clip rule alongside Uber/Nuro/Western Digital, but only the Program note was actually created. |
| Nuro (Serious) | — | — | 2026-07-29 | — | — | Same gap as Deepgram — Program note only. |
| Uber (Serious) | — | — | 2026-07-29 | — | — | Same gap as Deepgram — Program note only. |
| Western Digital (Serious) | — | — | 2026-07-29 | — | — | Same gap as Deepgram — Program note only. |
| HRT-Sophomore (Serious) | 2026-07-16 | 2026-07-16 | 2026-07-16 | — | — | **Explicitly withdrawn the same day it was created**, per [[20_Progress/Internship/Building System/System - Build Log|Build Log]]'s own 2026-07-16 entry ("Class-year correction... withdrew the HRT worked example"). Still sitting in `Programs/Serious/` more than five weeks later, not moved to `Ended/`, not discarded, no Contacts/Tracker note ever existed for it. |
## Note-Shape Conformance — Provisional
See [[Internship Loop Review Standard]]'s dependency warning — the checks below are graded against current templates/Pipeline prose only.
- Appian's trio uses the field names the current `Program`/`Tracking`/`Contact` templates actually use (`list_origin`, `recruiter_contact`, `applying_note` on the Program; `program`/`contact`/`related_notes` on the Tracker) and every cross-link resolves to a real file — checked directly, not assumed.
- Deepgram/Nuro/Uber/Western Digital's Program notes have no `created`/`updated`/`next` frontmatter fields at all — consistent with the Program Template not using those field names, not itself a defect, but it does mean there's no dated signal inside the note for *when* it last got real attention, which makes a gap like the missing Contacts/Tracker notes harder to notice without a review like this one.
## Findings
1. **Four of five `Serious/` programs (Deepgram, Nuro, Uber, Western Digital) are missing their Contacts and Tracker notes**, violating [[Internship Pipeline]] Step 3's "created together" rule and the pipeline's own `Done When` checklist. All four were committed the same day (2026-07-29) via the same manual-web-clip backfill described in Pipeline Step 1 — this looks like a one-time batch where only the Program-note half of the three-note commit ritual actually happened.
2. **HRT-Sophomore is a stale orphan** — created and withdrawn the same day (2026-07-16) per the project's own Build Log, still physically present in `Programs/Serious/` five-plus weeks later with no Contacts/Tracker note and no move to `Ended/` or deletion.
3. **Appian's Tracker note carries a time-relative claim that has since expired** — "no rush... reviewed until August 2026," written 2026-07-26, unrevisited as of this review (2026-08-23, inside August).
## Decided Fixes
None this pass — every finding above needs a real decision (create the missing notes now vs. decide these four aren't actually being pursued; discard HRT-Sophomore vs. keep it as a dated reference; re-evaluate Appian's timing now that August has arrived), not a mechanical correction with 100% clarity. Per [[Review Standard]]'s rule, a review naming a problem isn't authorization to resolve it here.
## Open Questions
- Are Deepgram/Nuro/Uber/Western Digital still being actively pursued, or did they quietly stall after the 2026-07-29 backfill? The answer decides whether the missing Contacts/Tracker notes are a real gap to close or a sign these should move toward discard.
- Should HRT-Sophomore be deleted outright (it was withdrawn same-day, never a real candidate) or kept in `Ended/` as a dated record of the class-year-eligibility mistake, the way [[Internship Notes Standard]] argues dossiers should be moved-not-deleted on removal? The Pipeline note doesn't state a rule for this Program-note case specifically.
- Has Appian's application-review timing actually opened now that it's August — worth a direct check against the company's own portal, not assumed from a five-week-old note.
## Next Period's Watch List
- Whether the Deepgram/Nuro/Uber/Western Digital gap closed (real Contacts/Tracker notes created) or was resolved by explicit discard.
- Whether HRT-Sophomore is still sitting in `Serious/` unmoved a second review in a row — a second consecutive sighting is stronger evidence this is a discipline gap, not a one-time oversight.
- Whether Appian moved off "no rush" now that its stated review window has arrived.
