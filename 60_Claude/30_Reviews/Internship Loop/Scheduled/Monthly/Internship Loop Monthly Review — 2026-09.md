# Internship Loop Monthly Review — 2026-09
==Second Promotion Review, 12 days after the first (2026-08-23). This period contains the single biggest promotion event in the pipeline's life — Prompts 26/27 — and it needs tracing carefully, because the vault's own record of what happened (`Claude Code Prompts.md`'s prior `next` field) turns out not to match what's actually in the vault.==
## Period Covered
2026-08-24 through 2026-09-04 (spans the end of August and the start of September; the last review closed out through 2026-08-23).
## Sources Reviewed
- [x] `Programs/Serious/` and `Programs/Considering/` (full listing, all 14 notes, frontmatter read on the 8 new ones)
- [x] `Contacts/Each One/` (full listing, all subfolders)
- [x] `Tracker/Each One/` (full listing, all subfolders)
- [x] `20_Progress/Internship/Applying/Now.md`, `Applied/`, and the 3 reference-stub files in that folder
- [x] [[Claude Code Prompts - Archive]]'s Prompts 26/27 entries — the only record of what those two prompts actually intended
- [ ] `Preperation/Interviews/` — not opened; nothing has reached that stage
## Pipeline Checklist
_Against [[30_Order/Workflows/Internship Pipeline]]'s own `Done When` list._
- [ ] **Every program actually pursued has a Program note, a Contacts note, and a Tracker note, all cross-linked — still fails, for a different reason than last time.** Last review: 4 of 5 `Serious/` programs (Deepgram, Nuro, Uber, Western Digital) missing their trio. **That gap is unchanged, 6 weeks after those Program notes were created** — still no Contacts/Tracker notes for any of the four. Separately, a **new instance of the same gap**: Prompt 27's entire 7-dossier "Batch B" list (Castleton Data Engineering, KeyBank Analytics, Genentech ML, LPL SWE, Regions Bank, DTCC, GE Vernova) appears in **none** of Programs/Contacts/Tracker — see Per-Program Trace.
- [ ] **No Applying note has gone more than a week without a Log entry while active — still vacuously true, but now more concerning.** `Applying/` still holds zero real per-application notes (only the 3 reference stubs: `2026-HRT-Sophomore.md`, `AI Applying.md`, `Applications-to-Create.md`) despite 14 total promotions now existing, 2 of them carrying deadlines that have already passed or land today (see Findings #1).
- [x] The Dashboard and the Kanban agree on what's currently in motion — both still show nothing applied.
- [x] No `Ended/` Program note sits without a matching Applying note — `Serious/Ended/` and `Considering/Ended/` are both still empty.
## Per-Program Trace
**Batch A (Prompt 26, 2026-08-30) — genuinely complete, all 8 dossiers, verified directly:** Manhattan Associates, Castleton DS/ML, Castleton Full-Stack, Fifth Third Bank, Deloitte landed in `Serious/`; Amex, LPL (Data Engineer), KeyBank (Data Intern) landed in `Considering/` — all 8 have a matching Contact note and Tracker note, all cross-links resolve. This is real, not assumed — file-by-file, not from a session report (none exists for this batch, see Open Questions).

**Batch B (Prompt 27, 2026-08-30) — never landed, confirmed by absence, not inferred.** None of its 7 dossiers (Castleton Data Engineering, KeyBank Analytics and Quantitative Modeling, Genentech Machine Learning, LPL Financial Software Engineer, Regions Bank, DTCC, GE Vernova) exist anywhere in `Programs/`, `Contacts/`, or `Tracker/`. `Claude Code Prompts.md`'s own prior `next` field described both prompts as run ("Prompts 26/27 pivot to actual promotion... two parallel Codebase sessions") — **that description doesn't hold for Batch B**. Either the second session never ran, ran and failed silently, or ran and its output was never committed. Not resolved this pass — flagged, not guessed at.

**Deadline check, run directly against today's date (2026-09-04) — the most urgent finding this review produced:**
| Program | Deadline | applying_note | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Castleton Commodities Intl — Data Science/ML Intern | 2026-09-01 | `null` | **Deadline already passed, 3 days ago, with no Applying note ever created.** |
| KeyBank — Data Intern (Key Technology & Services) | 2026-09-04 | `null` | **Deadline is today.** |
| Manhattan Associates — A.I. Developer Co-Op | 2026-09-30 | `null` | Not yet urgent, but worth flagging while the pattern is fresh. |

Two of the eight real, freshly-promoted Batch A programs have already reached or passed their deadline with zero downstream movement — Reach Out and Apply (Steps 4/7 of the Pipeline) never started for either. This is the concrete, dated version of the abstract "0 Applying notes" finding every prior review has stated: it isn't just a process gap, it's actively costing real opportunities right now.

**Carryover, unchanged from last review:**
- **Deepgram/Nuro/Uber/Western Digital** — still Program-note-only, 6 weeks after creation (2026-07-29), no Contacts/Tracker note ever created.
- **HRT-Sophomore** — still sitting in `Programs/Serious/`, still not moved to `Ended/` or discarded, 7+ weeks after being withdrawn the same day it was created (2026-07-16).
- **Appian's Tracker note still reads "no rush... reviewed until August 2026"** — the exact stale claim flagged last review (already expired then), now a full month further stale. This is now a second consecutive review finding the same unrevisited text — per the last review's own Watch List, "a second consecutive sighting is stronger evidence this is a discipline gap, not a one-time oversight." Confirmed: it is.
## Note-Shape Conformance — Provisional
Still graded against current templates/Pipeline prose only, per the Standard's dependency warning (the field-level note-definition work is still pending). Batch A's 8 new Program/Contact/Tracker trios use the same field names as Appian's (`list_origin`, `deadline_posted`, `deadline_real`, `applying_note`) and every cross-link resolves — consistent, not degraded, under load.
## Findings
1. **Two real deadlines reached or passed with zero Applying-note activity** — Castleton Commodities International (2026-09-01, already passed) and KeyBank Data Intern (2026-09-04, today). The most concrete evidence yet that the Reach Out/Apply gap has a real cost, not just a process-hygiene one.
2. **Prompt 27 (Batch B, 7 dossiers) never landed in the vault**, despite the live prompt file's own record describing both 26 and 27 as run. A real discrepancy between documented intent and live state — the same pattern this whole project keeps re-discovering in different forms.
3. **Carryover, unaddressed a second review in a row**: Deepgram/Nuro/Uber/Western Digital's missing Contacts/Tracker notes, HRT-Sophomore's orphaned status, and Appian's stale "no rush" reasoning. Per the last review's own stated bar, a second consecutive sighting confirms these are discipline gaps, not oversights.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Correction, 2026-09-05 — Finding #2 above ("Batch B never landed") was true when written, not after.** Later the same session this review was written, [[Prompt 1 Reboot - Building System Refresh Session (2026-09-04)]] recorded that all 7 Batch B dossiers were promoted that same day, reusing Prompt 27's existing contact research. Confirmed live 2026-09-05, file-by-file, not from a report: all 7 (Castleton Data Engineering, KeyBank Analytics and Quantitative Modeling, Genentech Machine Learning, LPL Financial Software Engineer, Regions Bank, DTCC, GE Vernova) have real Program+Contact+Tracker trios. Original finding left as written above, per this vault's dated-correction convention — it accurately describes the state at the moment this review ran.
>
> **A separate, more serious problem surfaced by the correction: 4 of those 7 Batch B programs, plus one Batch A program, already had a passed `deadline_posted` at creation time** — the promotion session backfilled research for postings that had closed days earlier, and neither this review nor the one before it caught it, because the Per-Program Trace's deadline table above was built by hand from the 3 dossiers already known, not by scanning every Program note's `deadline_posted` field. A comprehensive sweep run 2026-09-05 found **5 total** Program notes with a passed deadline: Castleton DS/ML (2026-09-01, already named above), Castleton Full-Stack (2026-09-01, missed entirely by this review), Castleton Data Engineering (2026-09-01, part of the "never landed" batch), KeyBank Data Intern/Key Tech & Services (2026-09-04, already named above), and KeyBank Analytics & Quantitative Modeling (2026-09-04, missed entirely). All 5 moved to a new `Programs/{Serious,Considering}/Missed/` subfolder 2026-09-05 (distinct from `Ended/`, which per [[Internship Pipeline]] means applied) — see each note's own dated Outcome section. This is the concrete case for why the rebuilt Review Standard adds a comprehensive, corpus-wide deadline sweep on its own fast cadence instead of relying on a review's hand-built deadline table.
## Decided Fixes
None this pass — every finding needs a human decision (chase the two urgent deadlines today, decide Batch B's fate, discard-or-keep HRT-Sophomore, re-evaluate Appian), not a mechanical correction, per the Review Standard's rule.
## Open Questions
- Did Castleton or KeyBank actually get applied to outside this pipeline's own tracking (e.g., directly on the company portal, untracked)? This needs a direct human answer, not something checkable from the vault.
- Why did Batch B never land — a session failure, a never-run second terminal, or a real result that was never committed? Worth a direct check if the answer matters for trusting future parallel-prompt batches.
- Is Appian still worth pursuing given the in-person 5-day/week requirement its own Tracker note already flags as "worth weighing"? A month of no movement may itself be the answer.
## Next Period's Watch List
- Whether Castleton/KeyBank's deadlines produced a real outcome (applied, missed, or discarded) — check first, before anything else, next time this runs.
- Whether Batch B gets re-run, and whether it succeeds this time.
- Whether Deepgram/Nuro/Uber/Western Digital/HRT-Sophomore move at all — a third consecutive unchanged sighting would be a stronger signal still.
