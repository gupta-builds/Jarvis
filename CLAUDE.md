# CLAUDE.md — Vault Operating Contract

This vault is a personal knowledge system powered by Claude Code. The assistant reads, writes, and maintains notes directly in Obsidian.

## Folder Roles

| Folder | Purpose | Claude Behavior |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `60_Claude/05_Clippings/` | Raw source material (articles, clips, imports) | Read-only input; never modify |
| `60_Claude/` | Claude-generated knowledge layer | Full write access; create distillations, summaries, reviews |
| `20_Progress/` | Active projects, career, mentorship | Read for context; update with user permission |
| `30_Order/` | Templates and system structure | Read for conventions; don't modify |
| `40_Resources/` | Reference knowledge, concepts, links | Read for context; add backlinks when relevant |
| `00_Inbox/` | User's quick capture | Read for context; don't modify unless asked |
| `50_Archive/` | Past courses, completed work | Read-only; historical reference |
| `.claude/` | Skills, agents, settings | Full write access for tooling |

## Core Rules

### Editing Behavior

1. **Prefer patching by heading** — Add content under existing headings instead of rewriting entire files.
2. **Preserve frontmatter** — Never remove or rename frontmatter keys unless explicitly asked.
3. **Search before creating** — Use MCP search to check if a note already exists before creating a new one.
4. **Respect maturity** — Notes with `status: tree` are stable; propose changes before modifying.

### Note Creation Conventions

When creating new notes, use this frontmatter template:

```yaml
---
type: evergreen      # or: input, concept, project, thought, brainstorm
status: sprout       # seed → sprout → tree (maturity)
created: YYYY-MM-DD
tags:
  - evergreen
notes:
  - "[[Related Note 1]]"
  - "[[Related Note 2]]"
next: "[[Next Action]]"  # optional
---
```

**Type guide:**
- `evergreen` — Distilled, reusable knowledge (`60_Claude/20_Distilled_Notes/`, `40_Resources/`)
- `input` — Raw captures, source summaries (`60_Claude/05_Clippings/`, `60_Claude/30_Source_Summaries/`)
- `concept` — Course concepts, definitions (`30_Order/Notes/`, `40_Resources/CS/`)
- `project` — Active work with outcomes (`20_Progress/`)
- `thought` / `brainstorm` — Inbox-style captures (`00_Inbox/`)

### Output Destinations

| Output Type | Destination |
|-------------|-------------|
| Session summaries | `60_Claude/10_Session_Logs/log.md` |
| Source distillations | `60_Claude/30_Source_Summaries/` |
| Evergreen knowledge | `60_Claude/20_Distilled_Notes/` |
| Project briefs | `60_Claude/40_Project_Briefs/` |
| Daily/weekly reviews | `60_Claude/50_Reviews/` |
| Indexes | `60_Claude/60_Indexes/` |

### Ingestion Workflow (05_Clippings → 60_Claude)

1. User adds source to `60_Claude/05_Clippings/`
2. Run `/ingest-clipping "filename.md"` or ask Claude to process it
3. Claude:
   - Reads the source
   - Extracts key claims, entities, concepts, quotes, actions
   - Creates summary in `60_Claude/30_Source_Summaries/`
   - Updates/creates entity pages where relevant
   - Adds backlinks to related notes
   - Appends to `60_Claude/10_Session_Logs/log.md`
4. User reviews in Obsidian, files or adjusts as needed

### Query Behavior

When answering questions:

1. **Search the Claude layer first** — Read `60_Claude/60_Indexes/Claude Layer Index.md` for relevant distillations
2. **Then search the wider vault** — Use MCP search for broader context
3. **Cite sources** — Link to notes that informed your answer
4. **File useful outputs** — If an answer deserves preservation, save it to `60_Claude/`

### Session End Protocol

At the end of each working session:

1. Update `60_Claude/10_Session_Logs/log.md` with what was done
2. Create or update a summary note if significant work occurred
3. List outcomes, open questions, and next steps
4. Optionally run `/closeday` for a daily summary
